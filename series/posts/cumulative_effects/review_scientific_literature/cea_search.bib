Abstract = {Canada's watersheds are under increasing pressure from the cumulative
   effects of human development. There is a recognized need to assess and
   manage cumulative effects to Canada's watersheds, but there has been
   limited assessment of the current capacity for cumulative effects
   assessment and management. This paper assesses the current capacity to
   implement and sustain watershed-based cumulative effects assessment and
   management in the South Saskatchewan Watershed. Eight core requisites
   and 40 capacity indicators for watershed cumulative effects assessment
   and management are assessed based on a survey of 73 watershed
   stakeholders. Results indicate that many of the perceived threats to the
   health of the South Saskatchewan Watershed are not subject to regulatory
   environmental assessment. Participants identified leadership and
   multi-stakeholder collaboration as the most important requisites for
   watershed cumulative effects assessment and management, but under-valued
   the importance of vertical and horizontal linkages to ensure that
   watershed plans and monitoring programs provide sufficient guidance to
   land uses and project development decisions. Participants believed
   current capacity to be lacking, or limited, across most assessment
   indicators, with data management and coordination and resources to
   ensure the long-term sustainability of watershed cumulative effects
   assessment and management as the most significant capacity constraints.
   Advancing watershed cumulative effects assessment and management in the
   South Saskatchewan Watershed requires a lead agency or consortium of
   agencies with a clear mandate for cumulative effects assessment, the
   legislated or regulatory means to ensure that watershed efforts
   influence land and water use and allocation decisions, the coordination
   of data and provision of specific guidance to monitoring programs, and
   long-term financial investment.},

Title = {An effective set of principles for practical implementation of marine
   cumulative effects assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {254-262},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The term ``cumulative effects assessment{''} is frequently used yet the
   underlying principles and definitions are poorly specified.
   Consequently, there is no consistency or standardisation in approaches
   leaving marine managers and developers perplexed on how best to
   discharge their legal obligations to undertake cumulative effects
   assessment. This paper explores some of the origins of the terminology
   and re-interprets how these may best be applied to standardise the
   vocabulary and approaches to cumulative effects assessment.
   We define cumulative effects assessment as a systematic procedure for
   identifying and evaluating the significance of effects from multiple
   sources/activities and for providing an estimate on the overall expected
   impact to inform management measures. The analysis of the causes (source
   of pressures and effects), pathways and consequences of these effects on
   receptors is an essential and integral part of the process.
   Environmental risk assessment concepts, in particular sound problem
   formulation, have been used to provide a clear structure for cumulative
   effects assessment. We recommend that risk screening, prioritisation and
   evaluation should be a critical component of cumulative effects
   assessment to facilitate a filtering of the complex issues for
   consideration of the likelihood of exposure of receptors to pressures
   and the likelihood of a receptor responding to those pressures. This
   paper is intended to provide practical assistance to marine
   environmental impact assessment practitioners, marine environmental
   regulators and policy makers. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment is a process of scientific analysis,
   social choice, and public policy development, yet the linkages among
   these domains are often less than transparent. Limits to scientific and
   technical assessment, issues of power and control of information, and
   episodic forms of civic engagement represent serious challenges to
   meaningful understanding of cumulative effects assessment and land-use
   planning. In articulating these challenges, I draw on case studies from
   Ontario's Lands for Life and Alberta's Land-use Framework to illustrate
   current limitations to cumulative effects assessment on public lands in
   Canada. As a partial remedy for these limitations, insights into a
   pragmatic approach to impact assessment, in contrast to decisionistic
   and technocratic approaches, offer a way forward through a more robust
   integration of scientific information, civic engagement, and public
   policy development. I also identify a need for longer-standing
   institutions that are dedicated to regional planning and cumulative
   effects assessment in Canada.},

   of existing monitoring practices in Canada and the presence of existing
   thresholds for aquatic ecosystem health assessments. It suggests that a
   sustainable framework is possible for cumulative effects assessment of
   Canadian waters that would result in integration of national indicators
   of aquatic health, integration of national initiatives (e.g., water
   quality index, environmental effects monitoring), and provide an avenue
   where long-term monitoring programs could be integrated with baseline
   and follow-up monitoring conducted under the environmental assessment

Abstract = {This study examines the capacity to support the cumulative effects
   assessment and management for watersheds. The research is set in the
   Lower Fraser River Basin, a densely populated sub-watershed in British
   Columbia's lower mainland. Eight requirements or requisites for the
   watershed cumulative effects assessment and management are applied to
   evaluate current capacity for implementation in the Lower Fraser, and to
   identify the areas in need of capacity development. Results show that
   advancing watershed cumulative effects assessment and management
   requires not only good science but also leadership in the coordination
   of monitoring programs, and in ensuring the appropriate incentives and
   penalties for engagement and nonengagement. The lack of leadership in
   this regard is the result of existing governance structures arranged
   around the political boundaries, which have produced over time multiple
   agencies and jurisdictional fragmentation. Notwithstanding this, we
   argue that the watershed is the most appropriate scale for assessing and
   managing the cumulative effects to complex ecosystems.},

Title = {Challenges to incorporating social and economic factors into cumulative
   effects assessments in Canada?s marine conservation areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The cumulative effects of human stressors are threatening marine
   ecosystems. While spatial management tools such as marine conservation
   areas can help mitigate cumulative effects, several decision-making
   challenges remain. A limited availability of information and lack of
   knowledge, inconsistent management approaches, and ineffective
   consideration of social-ecological interactions hinders current
   cumulative effects assessment and management efforts. We examined if and
   how ocean managers assess cumulative effects and incorporate them into
   their management practices. A survey of the three Canadian federal
   departments responsible for marine conservation areas was conducted, and
   focused on the extent to which social and economic factors are
   considered. Managers seemed to favor ecological factors over social and
   economic ones when evaluating cumulative effects, such as when defining
   the spatial and temporal scales to use in their assessments. Managers
   also indicated a need for greater access to social and economic data and
   information to improve their assessment and management decisions.
   Lastly, the lack of a standardized cumulative effects assessment
   framework and fragmented management approaches appeared to limit
   managers??? ability to adequately incorporate social and economic
   factors into assessments. The survey results indicated that a cumulative
   effects assessment framework that explicitly includes social and
   economic factors in addition to an enhanced understanding of the suite
   of factors that influence social-ecological interactions should be
   developed. This type of framework is essential to help achieve the
   long-term management solutions required to conserve the health and
   integrity of Canada's oceans and beyond.},

Title = {The Challenge of Developing Social Indicators for Cumulative Effects
   Assessment and Land Use Planning},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This paper provides a synopsis on social indicators as relevant to
   cumulative effects assessment and land use planning. Although much has
   been done to better understand the social dimensions of environmental
   assessment, empirical work has been lacking on social indicators that
   could be used either as measurable inputs or outputs for cumulative
   effects assessment and land use planning in different kinds of
   communities and regions. Cumulative effects models currently in practice
   often fail to address deeper issues of community and regional
   well-being. Against this gap, social scientists are being asked to make
   reliable generalizations about functional, measurable relationships
   between certain social indicators and land use change or scenarios. To
   address this challenge, the Alberta Research Council held a two-day
   workshop in 2005 with social scientists. The workshop resulted in a list
   of prioritized social indicators that could be included in cumulative
   effects modeling/assessments and land use planning. The top five social
   indicators included population growth rate, education attainment,
   self-assessed quality of life, equity, i.e., distribution of benefits,
   and locus of control. Although consensus on social indicators and social
   thresholds for cumulative effects models was not reached, the insight
   gained from the workshop will help inform future cumulative effects
   assessment and land use planning.},

Abstract = {As the density of development increases, there is a growing need to
   address the cumulative effects of project developments on the
   environment. In Canada this need has been recognized in legislation
   whereby new project developments that require an environmental
   assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act are required
   to address the cumulative effects of proposed project activities
   relative to the existing environmental condition. Unfortunately,
   existing stressor-based and effects-based approaches to environmental
   assessment do not adequately address cumulative effects as defined under
   the Act when used in isolation. However, elements from each approach can
   be conceptually incorporated into a holistic cumulative effects
   assessment framework. Key framework components include: (1) an
   effects-based assessment to determine existing accumulated environmental
   state, (2) a stressor-based assessment to predict potential impacts of
   new development relative to the existing environmental state, (3)
   post-development monitoring to assess the accuracy of impact predictions
   and to provide an avenue for adaptive management, and (4)
   decision-making frameworks to link scientific information to public
   opinion and managerial action. The key advantage of this framework is
   that it provides a more holistic, systematic approach for incorporation
   of ecological information into a scientific and management framework for
   cumulative effects assessment.},

Abstract = {Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the
   environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This
   challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable
   energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple
   activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory
   provide decision makers with adequate information about how the
   environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed
   activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise,
   however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in
   substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED
   investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change
   targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine
   environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED
   effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This
   review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects
   assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent
   research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges
   relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other
   activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the
   current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and
   limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards
   establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative
   to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision
   makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and
   services. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Risk assessment framework for cumulative effects (RAFCE)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Introduction: Regional environmental risk assessment is a practical
   approach to understanding and proactively addressing the cumulative
   effects of resource development in areas of regional importance.
   However, regional assessment is methodologically complex, and frameworks
   to identify and prioritize regional risk issues to guide effective
   management decisions are lacking. This research develops a risk and
   impacts-based cumulative effects assessment framework for scoping
   regional cumulative effects issues to guide present and future project
   and regional assessment. We operationalized the framework dubbed Risk
   Assessment Framework for Cumulative Effects (RAFCE) to assess the risks
   and impacts of proposed mining development in the Ring of Fire region of
   Northern Ontario, Canada.Methods: Methodologically, we built on existing
   studies to understand the key valued ecosystem components (VECs)
   impacted by mining; organized an expert Bowtie Risk Assessment Tool
   workshop and interviews to identify regional risks and define the VECs
   impacted by mining; and developed an impact prioritization model that
   helped quantify and prioritize impacts of mining.Results and Discussion:
   RAFCE enabled us to: a) identify drivers and impacts of cumulative
   effects and potential preventive and mitigation measures for effective
   cumulative effects management and b) describe, quantify, and rank the
   major impact and components of regional interest. Using RAFCE, we can
   identify and prioritize impacts that are cross-cutting,
   multisector-driven, synergistic, and relevant to a region, visualize and
   understand the risk management process, identify policy and management
   issues to prevent risks or mitigate impacts, and ultimately inform
   resource allocation for effective regional cumulative effects assessment
   outcomes. RAFCE is suitable for engaging diverse stakeholders in
   planning for regional cumulative effects assessment.},

Journal = {IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL},

Volume = {31},

Pages = {74-84},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of institutional arrangements as either
   facilitating or constraining the practice of watershed cumulative
   effects assessment and management (W-CEAM) within the context of the
   Grand River watershed (GRW), Canada. The research is based on document
   review, a focus group and 29 interviews conducted with academic experts,
   project proponents, government and watershed agencies representatives,
   non-governmental organization researchers, First Nations, and others
   with interest in the GRW. Information was gathered on existing policy
   and planning instruments, and relationships among the authorities and
   other partners that enable water resource management. Key facilitating
   factors for W-CEAM in the GRW include established institutions, a mature
   conservation authority and an ecological focus to resource management
   strategies, while constraining factors include obfuscation of leadership
   roles and lack of multi-scalar approaches to watershed science. We
   conclude that it is useful to conceptualize W-CEAM as characterized by
   both a managerial and a scientific ethos - the former facilitating the
   latter - and that institutional goodwill, political will and
   institutional capacity for innovation and creativity are additional
   institutional core requisites to W-CEAM.},

Abstract = {Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA) is a tool that can be useful in
   making decisions about natural resource management and allocation. The
   decisions to be made include those (i) necessary to construct planning
   and regulatory frameworks to control development activity so that
   societal goals will be achieved and (ii) whether or not to approve
   individual development projects, with or without conditions. The
   evolution of CEA into a more successful tool cannot occur independently
   of the evolution of decision making processes. Currently progress is
   painfully slow on both fronts. This paper explores some opportunities to
   accelerate improvements in decision making in natural resource
   management and in the utility of CEA as a tool to assist in making such
   decisions. The focus of the paper is on how to define the public
   interest by determining what is acceptable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment differs from conventional project-specific
   impact assessment by considering larger geographic study areas, longer
   time frames, and unrelated projects or activities. Cumulative
   assessments of right-of-way proposals pose particular challenges for
   several reasons: (1) no prescribed or standard methods currently exist;
   (2) there are inherent, but frequently unrecognized, differences between
   project-specific cumulative effects assessments and those done for
   resource management or planning purposes; and (3) conventional
   approaches are more applicable to developments that are isolated in
   space rather than in long, linear corridors. The ``representative
   areas{''} approach described here has been successfully used in recent
   federally and provincially regulated pipeline proposals in western
   Canada. With this approach, assessment of cumulative environmental
   effects is conducted for representative areas comprised of one or more
   1:50,000 scale map sheets. These areas are selected to include multiple
   project facilities or activities and to reflect biophysical conditions
   and administrative boundaries. Impact analyses conducted for these
   representative areas consider indices of landscape conditions and
   compare these to established or derived thresholds for indicator species
   or groups. The relative merits and disadvantages of this approach are
   discussed from the perspective of proponents, regulators, environmental
   organizations, and practitioners. The use of representative areas and
   landscape indices is concluded to be a proven alternative for linear
   projects of all sizes.},

Abstract = {By virtue of their linear nature, pipelines provide interesting dilemmas
   that one must face when determining how best to address project-related
   cumulative environmental effects. Effects from pipeline construction and
   operation can act in combination with other projects and activities such
   as resource extraction, recreational use, and other land-use practices
   to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The challenge is to
   first determine the environmental effects of the project. Three main
   types of disturbances stem from pipeline construction and operation:
   those concentrated around or emanating from a point or local area (e.g.,
   temporary work spaces), a linear area (e.g., right-of-way), or a
   regional area (e.g., emissions from compressor stations). Pipeline
   projects can also be separated into several phases including planning,
   construction, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment. Each of the
   project phases and associated activities has the potential to adversely
   affect environmental values. Pipelines, being linear, provide
   interesting cumulative effects issues. Key cumulative effects issues
   include habitat loss and fragmentation, access creation and management,
   upstream induced effects, and watercourse crossings. To effectively
   assess pipeline cumulative effects stakeholders should follow an
   established cumulative effects assessment (CEA) framework or approach.
   The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency's Cumulative Effects
   Assessment Practitioners Guide provides an example of a CEA framework
   that provides a starting point to assist the determination of the
   significance of cumulative effects as a result of pipeline development.
   As part of project-specific environmental assessments, the potential
   cumulative environmental effects are often identified, evaluated,
   mitigative measures proposed and the significance of effects assessed.
   Proper implementation of mitigative measures in the field is critical to
   the management of project-related cumulative effects. This paper argues
   that an overall CEA approach or framework for a pipeline project should
   be developed in a manner that is similar to a CEA for a non-linear
   project or non-pipeline project although it also recognizes that
   pipelines have some effects that are unique. Cumulative effects from
   pipelines can be managed by applying standard environmental assessment
   principles, using guidelines as frameworks to assist the undertaking of
   CEAs, and by ensuring mitigation is effectively applied.},

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessments in Canada are increasingly expected to
   include social impacts from resource development and land-use actions on
   people, their communities, and livelihoods. As processes and methods for
   assessing cumulative social effects develop, it is important to
   understand the capacity needs for implementing such an assessment. This
   paper explores the regulatory and professional capacity required to
   assess cumulative social effects of resource development projects.
   Semi-structured interviews were completed with professionals involved in
   environmental assessments for hydroelectric development in British
   Columbia and Manitoba, Canada. A number of key capacity needs are
   identified in terms of the availability regulation and guidance, the
   professional expertise needed, and understanding responsibilities and
   management for cumulative social effects. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of capacity needs and recommendations for improvements to
   support the implementation of a social cumulative effects assessment.},

Abstract = {This article examines watershed cumulative effects assessment and
   management (CEAM) in the Athabasca watershed, Alberta, Canada. Using a
   focus group and semi-structured interviews with 30 key informants from
   government, industry, NGOs, and First Nations, watershed CEAM was
   examined based on eight requisites to support CEAM: the presence of a
   lead agency; enabling legislation; financial and human resources; data
   management and coordination; multi-scaled monitoring; CEAM baselines,
   indicators, and thresholds; mult-istakeholder collaboration; and
   vertical and horizontal linkages. Results show that while there was
   broad agreement amongst participants concerning the necessity for these
   requisites, there was also considerable uncertainty respecting these
   requisite performances in this watershed. Several contributing factors
   may help explain this uncertainty. Participants noted a lack of
   willingness to share data to support CEAM, especially spatial data, as
   well as a lack of confidence in the integrity of water monitoring data.
   An absence of coordination and leadership for watershed CEAM has
   contributed to financial, human, and technical capacity limitations as
   well as power asymmetries respecting multi-stakeholder engagement. Our
   results suggest that notwithstanding investment in cumulative effects
   science and monitoring in the Athabasca, advancing watershed CEAM
   requires much greater attention to the institutional requisites to
   implement and sustain CEAM programs.},

Abstract = {Despite all the effort that has gone into defining, researching and
   establishing best practices for cumulative effects assessment (CEA),
   understanding remains weak and practice wanting. At one extreme of
   implementation, CEA can be described as merely an irritant to the
   completion of a project-specific environmental assessment (EA). At the
   other extreme, the conceptual view is that all effects in EA should be
   deemed cumulative unless demonstrated otherwise. Our purpose here is to
   consider how we might reconceive CEA as a mindset that is at the heart
   of absolutely every assessment of valued ecosystem component (VEC) to
   ensure that we understand the relative contributions of various
   stressors and can decide when cumulative effects may foreclose future
   activities due to impacts on VECs. Conceptually, we ground the CEA
   mindset in the context of three lenses that must all be functioning and
   working together for the mindset to be operative: a technical lens; a
   law and policy lens; and a participatory lens. Our arguments are based
   on a review of the CEA, strategic effects assessment (SEA) and regional
   effects assessment literatures, an examination and consideration of
   Canadian EA and SEA case practice, and our combined professional
   experiences. Through using the Bay of Fundy in Canada as a case example,
   we establish the concept of the CEA mindset and an approach for moving
   forward with implementation. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessments are often expected to include an analysis

   This paper critically examines how cumulative effects frameworks are

   by analyzing semi-structured interviews exploring practitioner
   experience in environmental assessments for hydroelectric development in
   British Columbia and Manitoba, Canada. The results provide a conceptual

Pages = {154-160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The constraints to assessing and managing cumulative environmental
   effects in the context of project-based environmental assessment are
   well documented, and the potential benefits of a more strategic approach
   to cumulative effects assessment (CEA) are well argued; however, such
   benefits have yet to be clearly demonstrated in practice. While it is
   widely assumed that cumulative effects are best addressed in a strategic
   context, there has been little investigation as to whether CEA and
   strategic environmental assessment (SEA) are a `good fit' - conceptually
   or methodologically. This paper identifies a number of conceptual and
   methodological challenges to the integration of CEA and SEA. Based on
   results of interviews with international experts and practitioners, this
   paper demonstrates that: definitions and conceptualizations of CEA are
   typically weak in practice; approaches to effects aggregation vary
   widely; a systems perspective lacks in both SEA and CEA; the
   multifarious nature of SEA complicates CEA; tiering arrangements between
   SEA and project-based assessment are limited to non-existing; and the
   relationship of SEA to regional planning remains unclear. (c) 2010

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) in Canada is in dire straits.
   Despite a huge amount of talk and a flurry of developmental activity
   associated with CEA concepts, it has not lived up to its glowing promise
   of helping to achieve sustainability of diverse valued ecosystem
   components. This article aims to articulate that failure, to examine it
   in terms of six major problems with CEA, and to propose solutions. The
   six problem areas include (1) application of CEA in project-level
   environmental impact assessments (EIAs), (2) an EIA focus on project
   approval instead of environmental sustainability, (3) a general lack of
   understanding of ecologic impact thresholds, (4) separation of
   cumulative effects from project-specific impacts, (5) weak
   interpretations of cumulative effects by practitioners and analysts, and
   (6) inappropriate handling of potential future developments. We advocate
   improvements not only within the purview of project-specific EIAs, but
   also mainly in the domain of region-scale CEAs and regional
   environmental effects frameworks (or perhaps land use planning). Only
   then will the CEA begin to approach the promise of securing
   sustainability of valued ecosystem components.},

Volume = {29},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Landscapes in Canada are undergoing change due to resource and land use
   stressors and climate stressors. Understanding the cumulative effects of
   these stressors is challenging because of the complexity of ecosystems,
   the variability of stressors, and species response to individual or
   multiple stressors. A key challenge within the field of cumulative
   effects assessment (CEA) is guidance that describes and evaluates
   analytical methods. In this review we discuss four broad categories of
   methods with current or potential use for project-based and
   effects-based CEA for species in terrestrial systems: (i) qualitative
   review, (ii) habitat supply models, (iii) empirical species-stressor
   models, and (iv) decision support models. We describe each method and
   provide examples, highlight advantages and limitations, identify how
   methods address key science-based CEA questions, and provide direction
   on when and why to use specific CEA methods. Empirical species-stressor
   models and decision support models are the only analytical approaches
   that provide answers to many science-based CEA questions including how
   multiple stressors combine to affect an individual species and the
   certainty of multiple stressor effects. We provide recommendations for
   using one or more methods as complementary building blocks to fill data
   gaps, improve understanding and communication, engage diverse partner
   groups, and increase the quality and credibility of the CEA. Our review
   supports a move toward regional scale, effects-based CEA where partner
   collaboration to design, implement, and analyze comprehensive

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is (or should be) an integral part
   of environmental assessment at both the project and the more strategic
   level. CEA helps to link the different scales of environmental
   assessment in that it focuses on how a given receptor is affected by the
   totality of plans, projects and activities, rather than on the effects
   of a particular plan or project.
   This article reviews how CEAs consider, and could consider, scale
   issues: spatial extent, level of detail, and temporal issues. It is
   based on an analysis of Canadian project-level CEAs and UK
   strategic-level CEAs. Based on a review of literature and, especially,
   case studies with which the authors are familiar, it concludes that
   scale issues are poorly considered at both levels, with particular
   problems being unclear or non-existing cumulative effects scoping
   methodologies; poor consideration of past or Rely future human
   activities beyond the plan or project in question; attempts to apportion
   `blame' for cumulative effects; and, at the plan level, limited
   management of cumulative effects caused particularly by the absence of
   consent regimes. Scale issues are important in most of these problems.
   However both strategic-level and project-level CEA have much potential
   for managing cumulative effects through better siting and phasing of
   development, demand reduction and other behavioural changes, and
   particularly through setting development consent rules for projects. The
   lack of strategic resource-based thresholds constrains the robust
   management of strategic-level cumulative effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Remnants of vegetation, to some extent, a result of human development,
   have vastly been altered and decreased in quality and quantity over the
   past decades in Australia. In order to rehabilitate these vitally
   important parts of ecosystems with the usually limited budget and
   logistical facilities, a sound scientific prioritization scheme is
   required. In this study in the Boorowa region to the north west of
   Canberra, Australia, we used the cumulative effects assessment approach
   to provide such prioritization scheme. We detected the change in
   quantity of remnant vegetation that had happened during the years 1973 -
   2000 using Landsat MSS and TM Images. We projected the change in
   quantity over the years 2000 - 2027 using a combination of cellular
   automata and neural network methods. We then used neural network and
   ground truth to model the structural complexity of the remnants as a
   measure of quality and linked that to the estimated change in quantity
   in the past and projected change in the future. Combining the assessed
   change in quantity and modelled change in quality of vegetation for the
   past and future provided a basis for prioritization of remnant
   vegetation for rehabilitation measures.},

Abstract = {Evaluating and comparing development alternatives with regard to
   sustainability is an important goal for comprehensive project appraisal.
   In the United States, this component has been largely missing from
   standard environmental impact assessment practice. Cumulative effects
   assessment provides a way to appraise the sustainability of project
   alternatives in terms of their probable contributions to long-term
   trends affecting the condition of valued environmental components.
   Sustainability metrics and predictors are being developed as criteria
   for rating systems and evaluation processes that are applied to
   community planning, building design, and transportation infrastructure.
   Increasing interest in adaptive management is also providing
   cost-effective solutions to optimizing safety and function throughout
   the long-term operation of a facility or infrastructure. Recent federal
   legislation is making it easier to integrate sustainability features
   into development alternatives through early, community-based planning.

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The cumulative effects of increasing human use of the ocean and coastal
   zone have contributed to a rapid decline in ocean and coastal resources.
   As a result, scientists are investigating how multiple, overlapping
   stressors accumulate in the environment and impact ecosystems. These
   investigations are the foundation for the development of new tools that
   account for and predict cumulative effects in order to more adequately
   prevent or mitigate negative effects. Despite scientific advances, legal
   requirements, and management guidance, those who conduct assessments
   including resource managers, agency staff, and consultants continue to
   struggle to thoroughly evaluate cumulative effects, particularly as part
   of the environmental assessment process. Even though 45 years have
   passed since the United States National Environmental Policy Act was
   enacted, which set a precedent for environmental assessment around the
   world, defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance are still
   major challenges associated with assessing cumulative effects. In
   addition, we know little about how practitioners tackle these challenges
   or how assessment aligns with current scientific recommendations. To
   shed more light on these challenges and gaps, we-undertook a comparative
   study on how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is conducted by
   practitioners operating under some of the most well-developed
   environmental laws around the globe: California, USA; British Columbia,
   Canada; Queensland, Australia; and New Zealand. We found that
   practitioners used a broad and varied, definition of impact for CEA,
   which led to differences in how baseline, scale, and significance were
   determined. We also found that practice and science are not closely
   aligned and, as such, we highlight opportunities for managers, policy
   makers, practitioners, and scientists to improve environmental
   assessment. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Developing a systematic simulation-based approach for selecting
   indicators in strategic cumulative effects assessments with multiple
   environmental valued components},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},
Number = {2},
Pages = {512-525},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Indicator selection is a critical step in conducting effective strategic
   cumulative effects assessments. Selecting an appropriate set of
   indicators to represent multiple and sometimes disparate values is
   particularly challenging because the interpretation of impacts depends
   on indicator roles and relationships among indicators. However,
   systematic approaches for selection of indicators for strategic
   cumulative effects assessments (CEA) are unclear. For a 909,000 ha case
   study area involving 214 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, we
   defined a suite of twenty indicators linked to six Valued Components
   (VCs) that could be forecasted for forest, riparian and species at risk
   as three key values consistent with present land-use planning policies
   in British Columbia, Canada. We used spatio-temporal process-based
   models to project and integrate the stressor-response relationships
   between forest harvesting and run-of-river power resource management
   activities and the suite of selected indicators. For a likely
   development scenario, we assessed the correlative structure among
   projected indicator responses and, using a PCA-based analysis of
   outcomes, identified both patterns of potential redundancies and
   ecological processes linking indicators and dominant processes
   influencing VCs. Our results suggest that strategic CEAs will benefit if
   indicator selections are not made independently for each VC. Identifying
   the type of indicator, i.e., pressure or condition, and scale of its
   representation was important in determining if assessed impacts for
   individual indicators could be appropriately integrated to quantify
   overall impacts in the landscape. Consideration of indicator-indicator
   relationships both within and among VCs clarifies the influences of
   spatial scale, potential redundancies among indicators, and the role of
   underlying ecological processes in interpreting and aggregating
   indicator responses. Our case study demonstrates that relative scales of
   ecological processes, disturbances and management actions can limit how
   cohesive the interpretations of impacts may be across VCs in strategic
   CEA. Analysis of correlative structures among the twenty indicators
   suggested criteria-based statistical redundancies occurred between only
   two indicator pairs, however PCA suggested three ecological processes
   (road disturbance, Spotted Owl habitat state, retention and recruitment
   of old forest) were operating to relate behaviors of multiple
   indicators. Careful consideration of the interacting roles of ecological
   processes as they relate to values is required when determining
   appropriate indicators and designing how best to aggregate indicator
   results into an effective strategic CEA. A three step systematic and
   generalizable approach to forecasting present and future states of
   indicators will improve efficiencies and effectiveness of strategic CEA.

Title = {Operationalizing risk-based cumulative effect assessments in the marine
   environment},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {724},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires an assessment of the cumulative
   effects of human pressures and environmental change. The
   operationalization and integration of cumulative effects assessments
   (CEA) into decision-making processes often lacks a comprehensive and
   transparent framework. A risk-based CEA framework that divides a CEA in
   risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation, could structure
   such complex analyses and facilitate the establishment of direct
   science-policy links. Here, we examine carefully the operationalization
   of such a risk-based CEA framework with the help of eleven contrasting
   case studies located in Europe, French Polynesia, and Canada. We show
   that the CEA framework used at local, sub-regional, and regional scales
   allowed for a consistent, coherent, and transparent comparison of
   complex assessments. From our analysis, we pinpoint four emerging issues
   that, if accurately addressed, can improve the take up of CEA outcomes
   by management: 1) framing of the CEA context and defining risk criteria;
   2) describing the roles of scientists and decision-makers; 3) reducing
   and structuring complexity; and 4) communicating uncertainty. Moreover,
   with a set of customized tools we describe and analyze for each case
   study the nature and location of uncertainty as well as trade-offs
   regarding available knowledge and data used for the CEA. Ultimately,
   these tools aid decision-makers to recognize potential caveats and
   repercussions of management decisions. One key recommendation is to
   differentiate CEA processes and their context in relation to governance
   advice, marine spatial planning or regulatory advice. We conclude that
   future research needs to evaluate how effective management measures are
   in reducing the risk of cumulative effects. Changing governance
   structures takes time and is often difficult, but we postulate that
   well-framed and structured CEA can function as a strategic tool to
   integrate ecosystem considerations across multiple sectorial
   policies.<bold> </bold>},

Title = {Perspectives from landscape ecology can improve environmental impact
   assessment},
Journal = {FACETS},

Volume = {6},
Pages = {358-378},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {The outcomes of environmental impact assessment (EIA) influence millions
   of hectares of land and can be a contentious process. A vital aspect of
   an EIA process is consideration of the accumulation of impacts from
   multiple activities and stressors through a cumulative effects
   assessment (CEA). An opportunity exists to improve the rigor and utility
   of CEA and EIA by incorporating core scientific principles of landscape
   ecology into EIA. With examples from a Canadian context, we explore
   realistic hypothetical situations demonstrating how integration of core
   scientific principles could impact EIA outcomes. First, we demonstrate
   how changing the spatial extent of EIA boundaries can misrepresent
   cumulative impacts via the exclusion or inclusion of surrounding natural
   resource development projects. Second, we use network analysis to show
   how even a seemingly small, localized development project can disrupt
   regional habitat connectivity. Lastly, we explore the benefits of using
   long-term historical remote sensing products. Because these approaches
   are straightforward to implement using publicly available data, they
   provide sensible opportunities to improve EIA and enhance the monitoring
   of natural resource development activities in Canada and elsewhere.},

Title = {A modelling framework for MSP-oriented cumulative effects assessment},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {171-181},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research presents a comprehensive Cumulative Effects Assessment
   (CEA) based on the Tools4MSP modelling framework tested for the Italian
   Adriatic Sea. The CEA incorporates five methodological advancements: (1)
   linear and non-linear ecosystem response to anthropogenic
   pressures/effects, (2) modelling of additive, dominant and antagonist
   stressor effects, (3) implementation of a convolution distance model for
   stressor dispersion modelling, (4) application of a CEA backsourcing
   (CEA-B) model to identify and quantify sources of anthropogenic
   pressures affecting environmental components, based on the convolution
   distance model and (5) a novel CEA impact chain visualization tool based
   on Sankey diagrams. Results from CEA in the Italian Adriatic Sea show
   that highest CEA scores are located in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Port
   of Trieste and Venice Lagoon inlets) while abrasion, marine litter and
   selective extraction are the most pronounced pressures within the 12 nm.
   Results from CEA-B application for two case studies evidence a clear
   distinction among local human impacts (trawling, small scale fishery)
   versus long-range diffusive human impacts (underwater noise and marine
   litter). Results were discussed for their geospatial outcomes,
   importance for transboundary effects assessment, conservation planning
   and future application potentials.},

Title = {Random forests as cumulative effects models: A case study of lakes and
   rivers in Muskoka, Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {201},
Pages = {407-424},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) a type of environmental appraisal
   lacks effective methods for modeling cumulative effects, evaluating
   indicators of ecosystem condition, and exploring the likely outcomes of
   development scenarios. Random forests are an extension of classification
   and regression trees, which model response variables by recursive
   partitioning. Random forests were used to model a series of candidate
   ecological indicators that described lakes and rivers from a case study
   watershed (The Muskoka River Watershed, Canada). Suitability of the
   candidate indicators for use in cumulative effects assessment and
   watershed monitoring was assessed according to how well they could be
   predicted from natural habitat features and how sensitive they were to
   human land-use. The best models explained 75\% of the variation in a
   multivariate descriptor of lake benthic-macroinvertebrate community
   structure, and 76\% of the variation in the conductivity of river water.
   Similar results were obtained by cross-validation. Several candidate
   indicators detected a simulated doubling of urban land-use in their
   catchments, and a few were able to detect a simulated doubling of
   agricultural land-use. The paper demonstrates that random forests can be
   used to describe the combined and singular effects of multiple stressors
   and natural environmental factors, and furthermore, that random forests
   can be used to evaluate the performance of monitoring indicators. The
   numerical methods presented are applicable to any ecosystem and
   indicator type, and therefore represent a step forward for CEA. Crown

Title = {Framework tool for a rapid cumulative effects assessment: case of a
   prominent wetland in Myanmar},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The wetland of focus, Inle Lake, located in centralMyanmar, is well
   known for its unique biodiversity and culture, as well as for ingenious
   floating garden agriculture. During the last decades, the lake area has
   seen extensive degradation in terms of water quality, erosion,
   deforestation, and biodiversity concomitant with a major shift to
   unsustainable land use. The study was conducted, with an emphasis on
   water quality, to analyze environmental impacts (effects) changing the
   ecosystem and to comprehensively evaluate the environmental state of the
   ecosystem through an innovative Rapid Cumulative Effects Assessment
   framework tool. The assessment started with a framework-forming
   Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which quantified and prioritized
   impacts over space and time. Critically important impacts were assessed
   for ``intra-inter interactions{''} using the loop analysis simulation.
   Water samples were analyzed while geographic information system (GIS)
   and remote sensing were used to identify water pollution hotspots. It
   was concluded that out of a plethora of impacts, pollution from
   municipal sources, sedimentation, and effects exerted by floating
   gardens had the most detrimental impacts, which cumulatively affected
   the entire ecosystem. The framework tool was designed in a broad sense
   with a reference to highly needed assessments of poorly studied wetlands
   where degradation is evident, but scarcely quantified, and where long-
   term field studies are fraught with security issues and resource
   unavailability (post- conflict, poor and remote regions, e.g.,
   Afghanistan, Laos, Sudan, etc.)},

Title = {Inclusive approaches for cumulative effects assessments},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {431-445},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The cumulative impacts of human activities and natural disturbance are
   leading to loss and extinction of species, ecological communities and
   biocultural connections people have to those ecosystems. Exclusive and
   extractive western science methodologies often hinder the inclusion of
   Indigenous knowledge holders in cumulative effects assessments (CEAs),
   which can lead to regional conflict and ineffective assessment and
   management of cumulative effects.We offer our reflections on the
   development of a collaborative CEA process with the Kitasoo Xai'xais,
   Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations in what is now known as the Central
   Coast of British Columbia. We designed our CEA around the guiding
   principles of respecting Indigenous sovereignty and regional autonomy,
   designing for trauma-informed approaches, and prioritizing inclusivity
   and reciprocity. We focused our efforts on identifying current and
   future pressures on species of the Nations' choice.We relied on expert
   elicitation and data-driven approaches to identify and map current and
   future cumulative impacts to predict their consequences for species'
   health. We used combinations of visualizations, numerical, oral and
   written materials to convey, elicit and share complex information with
   experts.We found a diversity of elicitation processes fostered the
   involvement of a variety of experts (e.g. Indigenous knowledge holders
   and Nation staff, regional biologists, Crown managers, tenure holders).
   We mapped over 90+ impacts to species in the region and after
   conversation and facilitated elicitation processes with over 50
   knowledge holders, emerged with predictions for the consequences of
   seven plausible scenarios of future cumulative impacts for eight species
   as well as broad themes for the management of cumulative impacts to the
   lands and waters of the Nations with whom we collaborated. Our shared
   lessons can support researchers, planners, proponents, and Indigenous
   and colonial government agencies to conduct inclusive, collaborative and
   accessible CEAs that inform regional land and marine use planning.},

Title = {Do voluntary corporate actions improve cumulative effects assessment?
   Mining companies' performance on Sami lands},
Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {375-383},

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) remains an Achilles heel in the
   licensing of mining projects on indigenous lands globally, but
   especially in the European North. Yet, rather than legislating on
   indigenous rights and CEA failures, governments tend to rely on
   companies to mitigate cumulative impacts through new corporate social
   responsibility actions. This paper considers if these voluntary actions
   improve companies' CEA performance and so provide grounds for indigenous
   communities and decision makers to trust the industry more. Findings are
   presented from a systematic review of corporate impact assessments for
   56 mining concession permit applications on Sami lands in Sweden. We
   show how companies that adopt additional voluntary measures provide
   somewhat richer assessments. Overall, however, the performance remains
   poor also for `frontrunners', with persistent lack of clarity on methods
   and limited analysis of consequences, social and cultural impacts and
   interactions with other (past, present or future) projects. We conclude
   that progress in voluntary actions in regard to assessing cumulative
   impacts has only led to cosmetic improvements in CEA performance. We
   therefore argue for stronger regulatory role of government and
   recognition of the right of indigenous communities to lead or co-manage
   impact assessments on their own lands.},

Abstract = {In strategic cumulative effects assessments, significant methodological
   challenges exist for classifying and aggregating impacts when using
   multiple indicators to determine relative risks upon ecological values
   from anthropogenic developments. We present a strategic spatial modeling
   case study CEA (2012-2112) in a 909,000 ha forested landscape of
   Southwestern British Columbia. We explore decisions needed to calculate
   and aggregate modeled indicators of cumulative anthropogenic footprints
   on landscape conditions by examining the choice of quantitative methods.
   We compare how aggregated impact conclusions may differ for seven
   indicators grouped in two ways to represent three ecological values
   (Forest Ecosystems, Riparian Ecosystems and Species at Risk): four
   expert-defined policy-driven valued components (VCs) or three
   analytically derived environmental resource factors (ERFs). By
   explicitly demonstrating methodological choices at each step of impact
   estimation and aggregation, we outline a practical systematic approach
   to customize strategic CEAs of this type and retain transparency for
   interpreting impacts among values. Aggregated impacts for VCs appeared
   dominated by those estimated from ``condition{''} indicators describing
   the degree of expected deviations in indicator states from desired
   conditions; aggregated impacts of ERFs were dominated by ``pressure{''}
   indicators linked to underlying causal processes assumed important for
   describing changes in future ecological conditions. High spatial
   congruence occurred between impact statements for some VCs compared to
   ERFs representing the same ecological value; poor congruence between
   others likely occurred because they represented different ecological
   processes. Aggregated impact classifications may usefully signal impact
   severity and risk but are dependent on indicator grouping, hence choices
   for aggregation are integral to the assessment process.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},

Volume = {64},
Pages = {67-76},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Indigenous-state collaboration in the governance of cumulative effects
   assessment (CEA) is often hampered not only by legacies of colonialism
   and inequality but also disagreement on what the `CEA governance
   problem' is in the first place. In this paper, we draw on critical
   theories on dialogue and collaboration to present a novel approach to
   joint problem analysis between Sami reindeer herders and civil servants
   in Swedish permitting authorities on mining, wind energy and forestry.
   We discuss process design choices, insights on CEA governance and ways
   to tackle these barriers in practice. We argue that indigenous-state
   collaboration may play a constructive role in improving CEA governance,
   including the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights. However, this
   requires a process that carves out new spaces for exploring divergent
   problem definitions and supports the participants in challenging
   institutionalized inequalities within their positioned realities. (C)

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Many of the world's ecosystems are experiencing a suite of changes from
   anthropogenic activities; the multiple stressors from those activities
   result in cumulative impacts. Understanding how these activities
   translate into ecological consequences is exceedingly challenging
   because of the inherent complexity within natural systems and the
   variability in how stressors act and how species respond. While there
   have been substantial advancements within the field of cumulative
   effects assessment to address these issues and improve our understanding
   of the consequences of our actions, many challenges remain. Here, we
   detail advances and remaining challenges, and propose five priorities
   for addressing these challenges in the near future. In particular, we
   suggest prioritizing risk-based approaches that account for uncertainty
   in our understanding and establishing an underlying theory for when we
   expect particular impacts to occur. We also propose the need for a
   defined subdiscipline focused on cumulative effects, to help reduce the
   silos of research that are often disconnected, and to work toward a
   common set of definitions, methods and the consistent use of open data.},

Title = {Re-grounding cumulative effects assessments in ecological resilience},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessments (CEA) evolved to holistically understand
   and account for the impact of a spectrum of human and natural
   disturbances on ecosystems. Yet, the practice of CEA has struggled to
   overcome siloed and reductionist underpinnings common in the impact
   assessment arena. One way to move CEA towards more integrated approaches
   is by drawing on the concept of ecological resilience. Despite gaining
   considerable attention in other academic spheres, however, ecological
   resilience remains largely unexplored in CEAs. Motivated by this gap,
   the objective of this article is to explore how CEAs can be reimagined
   through an ecological resilience lens to cultivate more integrated and
   holistic CEA practices. We provide a brief synthesis of CEA theory and
   practice, highlighting where reductionist, disciplinary, and siloed
   approaches prevail. Then, we explore three shifts that could recast CEA
   through the concept of ecological resilience: (1) a shift from valued
   ecological components to values/identity (resilience pivots), (2) a
   shift from baseline assessments to ecological trajectories, and (3) a
   shift from management thresholds to safe operating spaces. We argue that
   intersecting the practice of CEA with the concept of ecological
   resilience offers a real opportunity to extend beyond simply being
   passive respondents to an incremental ``death by 1000 cuts{''} to
   cultivating the conditions needed for ecological adaption and
   transformation along desirable pathways.},

Title = {Institutional requirements for watershed cumulative effects assessment

Abstract = {Watersheds are under increasing stress from the cumulative environmental
   effects of water and land use disturbances caused by both anthropogenic
   and natural causes. Yet, while the science of watershed cumulative
   effects assessment and management (CEAM) is advancing much less is known
   about the institutional and capacity requirements to implement and
   sustain watershed CEAM. Based on lessons from a transboundary watershed
   in western Canada this paper presents eight institutional requirements,
   or requisites, for the implementation of watershed-based CEAM. We
   suggest that effective watershed CEAM requires government leadership to
   move beyond the current inward focus on project approvals toward an
   outward focus on the cumulative effects of all disturbances in a
   watershed; complementary monitoring programs at the project and
   watershed scale, and a means to ensure the sharing of monitoring data
   across watershed stakeholders; and a nested planning framework to
   coordinate watershed planning objectives with individual project impact
   assessment and decision making. Results of this paper show that simply
   scaling up from individual project-based assessments to the watershed
   scale exposes many institutional constraints that can impede CEAM
   action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Improving links between environmental accounting and scenario-based
   cumulative impact assessment for better-informed biodiversity decisions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Increasing attention is being given to understanding how intensifying
   human activities combine over space and time to influence persistence of
   biodiversity. Two types of biodiversity assessment in particular are
   attracting growing interest: one focused on understanding
   past-to-present change (environmental accounting) and another focused on
   understanding likely present-to-future changes under proposed scenarios
   of future actions (cumulative impact assessment of scenarios). Here we
   highlight the potential benefits of improving the links between
   environmental accounting and scenario-based cumulative impact assessment
   for biodiversity, using a case study for subterranean fauna in the
   Pilbara region of Australia. Using a flexible and comprehensive
   model-based analytical approach, we assessed expected change in
   biodiversity persistence given past development, and likely change to
   2100 under a proposed development scenario for the region. Our
   assessment shows both the times (2005-2015) and places (Fortescue
   sub-region) where development activities are likely to have most
   strongly influenced long-term biodiversity persistence for subterranean
   fauna in the Pilbara region. Although mining development has often
   occurred in areas that have a high value for subterranean fauna
   diversity, our linked environmental accounting and cumulative impact
   assessment suggest relatively modest impacts on long-term persistence
   for this component of biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Our
   study provides an effective demonstration of the capacity and potential
   benefits of better linking environmental accounting with scenario-based
   cumulative impact assessment. Improving the links between these two
   perspectives on biodiversity assessment will create benefits for both,
   providing a consistent basis for cumulative impact assessments and
   enhancing the usefulness of environmental accounting.},

Title = {A Global review of cumulative effects assessments of disturbances on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {317},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper reviews trends in the academic literature on cumulative
   effects assessment (CEA) of disturbance on forest ecosystems to advance
   research in the broader context of impact assessments. Disturbance is
   any distinct spatiotemporal event that disrupts the structure and
   composition of an ecosystem affecting resource availability. We
   developed a Python package to automate search term selection, write
   search strategies, reduce bias and improve the efficient and effective
   selection of articles from academic databases and grey literature. We
   identified 148 peer-reviewed literature published between 1986 and 2022
   and conducted an inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the
   results. Our findings revealed that CEA studies are concentrated in the
   global north, with most publications from authors affiliated with
   government agencies in the USA and Canada. Methodological and analytical
   approaches are less interdisciplinary but mainly quantitative and
   expert-driven, involving modeling the impacts of disturbances on
   biophysical valued components. Furthermore, the assessment of
   socioeconomic valued components, including the effects of disturbance on
   Indigenous wellbeing connected to forests, has received less attention.
   Even though there is a high preference for regional assessment,
   challenges with data access, quality, and analysis, especially baseline
   data over long periods, are hampering effective CEA. Few articles
   examined CEA - policy/management nexus. Of the few studies, challenges
   such as the inadequate implementation of CEA mitigation strategies due
   to policy drawbacks and resource constraints, the high cost of
   monitoring multiple indicators, and poor connections between
   scenarios/modeling and management actions were paramount. Future CEA
   research is needed to broaden our understanding of how multiple
   disturbance affects forests in the global south and coupled social and
   ecological systems and their implications for sustainable forest
   management.},

Abstract = {Fast-paced watershed change, driven by anthropogenic development, is
   threatening the sustainability of freshwater resources across the globe.
   Developments within watersheds interact in a manner that is additive and
   synergistic over space and time. Such cumulative environmental effects
   are defined as the results of actions that are individually minor but
   collectively significant when added to other past, present, and
   reasonably foreseeable future actions. Cumulative effects assessment
   (CEA) then is broadly defined as the process of evaluating the potential
   impacts of such collective actions on the environment and is a
   requirement in many countries, including in Canada at the federal level
   under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. However, current
   approaches to CEA for river systems are proving to be ineffective, which
   is largely attributed to the disconnect between CEA science and
   practice. We highlight this gap herein by discussing contradictions in
   the CEA literature, challenges in quantifying cumulative interactions,
   including overcoming spatiotemporal scale issues, multiple hydrologic
   and ecological pathways, and lack of predictive analysis. Our analysis
   shows there is a need for improved CEA for river systems, and in
   responding to this need we propose a conceptual framework for better
   integrating science and practice for improved CEA for river systems
   using one of the most adversely affected rivers basins in Canada, the
   Athabasca River, as our model. We conclude by addressing the challenges
   inherent to CEA with the intent of providing scientists with ways to
   help improve CEA of river systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Setting social, economic, and ecological objectives is ultimately a
   process of social choice informed by science. In this special feature we
   provide a multidisciplinary framework for the use of cumulative effects
   assessment in land use planning. Forest ecosystems are facing
   considerable challenges driven by population growth and increasing
   demands for resources. In a suite of case studies that span the boreal
   forest of Western Canada to the interior Atlantic forest of Paraguay we
   show how transparent and defensible methods for scenario analysis can be
   applied in data-limited regions and how social dimensions of land use
   change can be incorporated in these methods, particularly in aboriginal
   communities that have lived in these ecosystems for generations. The
   case studies explore how scenario analysis can be used to evaluate
   various land use options and highlight specific challenges with
   identifying social and ecological responses, determining thresholds and
   targets for land use, and integrating local and traditional knowledge in
   land use planning. Given that land use planning is ultimately a
   value-laden and often politically charged process we also provide some
   perspective on various collective and expert-based processes for
   identifying cumulative impacts and thresholds. The need for good science
   to inform and be informed by culturally appropriate democratic processes
   calls for well-planned and multifaceted approaches both to achieve an
   informed understanding of both residents and governments of the
   interactive and additive changes caused by development, and to design
   action agendas to influence such change at the ecological and social
   level.},

Abstract = {Environmental impact or effects assessment (EIA, EEA) is a predictive
   exercise, legislated to proceed via a variety of defined administrative
   processes in different jurisdictions in the world. An important weakness
   is the inability to test effects predictions before they occur, and
   another weakness is infrequent follow-up monitoring providing
   information useful for post-development cumulative effects assessment
   and restoration or reclamation of lands and waters. Ideally, EEA is part
   of a comprehensive regional environmental planning and management
   process, falling between long-term regional planning and
   post-development protective regulation and restoration. Ecologically
   sound EEA and restoration within this greater context are best effected
   via reestablishing and maintaining landscape integrity. This, in turn,
   is managed best by ensuring reestablishment and maintenance of
   biodiversity and ecological processes in relation to the ecosystem
   components most valued by relevant human groups. The administrative
   process by means of which this environmental management goal may be
   effected must be flexible and adaptive so as to incorporate natural
   environmental change and human cultural dynamics.},

Abstract = {Cumulative environmental change or cumulative effects may result from
   the additive effect of individual actions of the same nature or the
   interactive effect of multiple actions of a different nature. This
   article reviews conceptual frameworks of cumulative environmental change
   and describes analytical and institutional approaches to cumulative
   effects assessment (CEA). A causal model is a common theoretical
   construct, although the frameworks vary in their emphasis on different
   components of the model. Two broad approaches to CEA are distinguished:
   one scientific and the other planning oriented. These approaches should
   not be interpreted as competing paradigms but rather different
   interpretations of the scope of CEA. Each approach can provide a
   distinct but complementary contribution to the analysis, assessment, and
   management of cumulative effects. A comparison of the institutional and
   legislative response to CEA in Canada and the United States shows that
   Canada is following the American example of incorporating the analysis
   and assessment of cumulative effects into regulatory actions and
   administrative procedures that also govern environmental impact
   assessment.},

Title = {Mapping cumulative impacts on Hong Kong's pink dolphin population},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {51-63},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins have historically inhabited the northern
   waters off Lantau Island, Hong Kong; however their numbers have
   significantly decreased over the past decade, while human pressure has
   simultaneously increased. Based on a spatio-temporal analysis using a
   Geographic Information System (GIS), this study aims to assess the
   cumulative human impacts of local activities on this dolphin population
   since 1996. After introducing and discussing the multiple approaches,
   difficulties, and limitations to cumulative effects assessments (CEA),
   this paper outlines our proposed CEA methodology. Our methodology
   involves mapping and analysis of anthropogenic marine impacts in
   relation with historical dolphin distributions in the area. Local scale
   results show evidence of a relationship between the addition of new
   high-speed ferry (HSF) routes into the cumulative environment and the
   decrease in dolphins in a specific region known as the Brothers Islands.
   These results coincide with past research showing that whales and
   dolphins are significantly disrupted in the presence of high vessel
   traffic, which continues to grow in the northern waters off Lantau
   Island, Hong Kong and in many other places around the world. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This article reports on an experimental civic engagement approach to
   link community observed cumulative effects of numerous local events and
   periods of resource development to indicators for sustainable forest and
   land management for the future. We describe a process where the
   interview findings with 28 key aboriginal and non-aboriginal informants
   in the Champagne Aishihik First Nations' (CAFN) Traditional Territory
   were summarized into key themes by researchers in a community workshop
   to elicit a selection of social indicators for future cumulative effects
   assessments. These responses were visions for the future based on a
   great deal of experiential learning that interviewees identified part
   and parcel of any betterment to the community as new developments
   unfold. Themes such as ``social healing{''} were further broken into
   indicators such as ``community support systems{''} and then further
   broken into local measures, such as ``the presence of, and access to, a
   youth centre, youth programs, and youth centres{''}. The local
   historical approach to cumulative effects assessment helps us not only
   understand more about forestry, but more about the broader connections
   between community members and leaders, forestry and other resource
   developments, and lessons people have learned from the past and visions
   for the future.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the cumulative effects
   of multiple human pressures. Cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) are
   needed to inform environmental policy and guide ecosystem-based
   management. Yet, CEAs are inherently complex and seldom linked to
   real-world management processes. Therefore we propose entrenching CEAs
   in a risk management process, comprising the steps of risk
   identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. We provide guidance
   to operationalize a risk-based approach to CEAs by describing for each
   step guiding principles and desired outcomes, scientific challenges and
   practical solutions. We reviewed the treatment of uncertainty in CEAs
   and the contribution of different tools and data sources to the
   implementation of a risk based approach to CEAs. We show that a
   risk-based approach to CEAs decreases complexity, allows for the
   transparent treatment of uncertainty and streamlines the uptake of
   scientific outcomes into the science-policy interface. Hence, its
   adoption can help bridging the gap between science and decision-making
   in ecosystem-based management. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {This paper describes a potential approach to the assessment of
   cumulative effects that may be adopted for larger federally regulated
   pipelines in Canada. The approach is based on a process originally
   developed for pipelines in the Rocky Mountain foothills of western
   Canada; therefore, the environmental components selected reflect some
   that are common for that region. The approach is based on the author's
   experiences in conducting cumulative effects assessments in Canada.
   Conditions or ``triggers{''} are discussed under which cumulative
   effects need to be considered for a pipeline project, establishing an
   effects-based approach for assessing only those portions of the pipeline
   potentially contributing to cumulative effects. This establishes a
   focused approach that clearly identifies the scope of assessment.
   Specific pipeline effects that typically contribute to regional
   cumulative effects issues are identified, and approaches for assessing
   the significance of project contributions to such effects are broadly
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Humans have always viewed the marine environment as an important
   resource including using the marine environment to dispose of their
   waste. In order to protect the marine environment and manage the
   activities, various national legislative approaches have been
   implemented to address the requirements of the international London
   Protocol/ London Convention (LPLC). The LPLC aims to prevent and reduce
   pollution of the sea associated with dumping of wastes and other matter.
   Although not a prerequisite of the London Protocol, regional and
   national regulatory frameworks require that assessments for disposing
   waste at sea include a cumulative effects context considering the
   effects from other marine activities occurring in a given area. Here we
   review a selection of cumulative effect assessment approaches and
   principles that could be applied to enhance the assessment requirements
   of the LPLC. We recommend that those countries that are parties to the
   LCLP consider which CEA approach is of most applicable to their own
   country and activities, perhaps a combination, and ensure robust
   assessments are carried out to ensure the marine environment is as
   sustainably managed as possible.},

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA), as a required practice for the
   environmental assessment (EA) of projects in many countries, faces
   several practical challenges, especially related to biodiversity.
   Drawing on the perspectives and experiences of Canadian EA
   practitioners, this paper explores options or drivers of change for
   improving project-based assessment to better tackle cumulative effects
   on biodiversity. An on-line survey was conducted with 40 professionals
   from the private sector, government departments/agencies, universities,
   and non-governmental organizations, examining the current challenges and
   opportunities regarding: CEA process for biodiversity; responsibilities
   for undertaking CEA tasks; resources to support and promote good CEA
   practice. In terms of process, there is shared understanding on: (i) the
   need of EA terms of reference to provide specific directions on CEA;
   (ii) CEA should capture both human and natural drivers of cumulative
   change; (iii) spatial boundaries for CEA should be based on ecological
   boundaries. There are dissenting views about: (i) whether CEA should
   consider all valued components (VCs) potentially affected by a project
   or only those for which residual effects are predicted; and (ii)
   delimitation of future temporal limits. In terms of responsibilities,
   participants agreed that project proponents should retain a central role
   in conducting CEA, but government agencies should lead the
   collection/provision of information about other projects in the study
   area and baseline VC conditions. Information and knowledge management
   resources could be also applied in the context of governmental agencies
   and consultancy firms to support CEA for biodiversity.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment of chemical exposures in urban environments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {872-881},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We performed a cumulative risk assessment for people living in a
   hypothetical urban environment, called Urbania. The main aims of the
   study were to demonstrate how a cumulative risk assessment for a
   middle-sized European city can be performed and to identify the
   bottlenecks in terms of data availability and knowledge gaps. The
   assessment focused on five air pollutants (i.e., PM10, benzene, toluene,
   nonane and naphthalene) and six food pesticides (i.e., acetamiprid,
   carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, imidacloprid and permethrin).
   Exposure predictions showed that PMIG, benzene and naphthalene exposure
   frequently exceeded the standards, and that the indoor environment
   contributed more than the outdoor environment. Effect predictions showed
   that mixture and interaction effects were generally limited. However,
   model calculations indicated potential synergistic effects between
   naphthalene and benzene and between chlorpyrifos, diazinon and toluene.
   PM10 dominated the health impact expressed in Disability Adjusted Life
   Years (DALYs). We conclude that measures to reduce the health impact of
   environmental pollution should focus on the improvement of indoor air
   quality and the reduction of PM10 emissions. Cumulative risk assessment
   can be improved by (1) the development of person-oriented exposure
   models that can simulate the cumulative exposure history of individuals,
   (2) a better mechanistic understanding of the effects of cumulative
   stressors, and (3) the development of instruments to prioritize
   stressors for inclusion in cumulative risk assessments. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Scenarios and scenario analysis have become popular approaches in
   organizational planning and participatory exercises in pursuit of
   sustainable development. However, they are little used, at least in any
   formal way, in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is puzzling
   because EIA is a process specifically dedicated to exploring options for
   more-sustainable (i.e., less environmentally damaging) futures. In this
   paper, we review the state of the art associated with scenarios and
   scenario analysis, and describe two areas where scenario analysis could
   be particularly helpful in EIA: (a) in defining future developments for
   cumulative effects assessment; and (b) in considering the influence of
   contextual change - e.g. climate change - on impact forecasts for
   specific projects. We conclude by encouraging EIA practitioners to learn
   about the promise of scenario-based analysis and implement
   scenario-based methods so that EIA can become more effective in
   fostering sustainable development. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Tools4MSP: an open source software package to support Maritime Spatial
   Planning},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents the Tools4MSP software package, a Python-based Free
   and Open Source Software (FOSS) for geospatial analysis in support of
   Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and marine environmental management. The
   suite was initially developed within the ADRIPLAN data portal, that has
   been recently upgraded into the Tools4MSP Geoplatform
   (data.tools4msp.eu), an integrated web platform that supports MSP
   through the application of different tools, e.g., collaborative
   geospatial modelling of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) and marine
   use conflict (MUC) analysis. The package can be used as stand-alone
   library or as collaborative webtool, providing userfriendly interfaces
   appropriate to decision-makers, regional authorities, academics and MSP
   stakeholders. An effective MSP-oriented integrated system of web-based
   software, users and services is proposed. It includes four components:
   the Tools4MSP Geoplatform for interoperable and collaborative sharing of
   geospatial datasets and for MSP-oriented analysis, the Tools4MSP package
   as stand-alone library for advanced geospatial and statistical analysis,
   the desktop applications to simplify data curation and the third party
   data repositories for multidisciplinary and multilevel geospatial
   datasets integration. The paper presents an application example of the
   Tools4MSP GeoNode plugin and an example of Tools4MSP stand-alone library
   for CEA in the Adriatic Sea. The Tools4MSP and the developed software
   have been released as FOSS under the GPL 3 license and are currently
   under further development.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Many countries have made statutory commitments to ensure that underwater
   noise pollution is at levels which do not harm marine ecosystems.
   Nevertheless, coordinated action to manage cumulative noise levels is
   lacking, despite broad recognition of the risks to ecosystem health. We
   attribute this impasse to a lack of quantitative management targets-or
   ``noise budgets{''}-which regulatory decision-makers can work toward,
   and propose a framework of risk-based noise exposure indicators which
   make such targets possible. These indicators employ novel noise exposure
   curves to quantify the proportion of a population or habitat exposed,
   and the associated exposure duration. This methodology facilitates both
   place-based and ecosystem-based approaches, enabling the integration of
   noise management into marine spatial planning, risk assessment of
   population-level consequences, and cumulative effects assessment. Using
   data from the first international assessment of impulsive noise
   activity, we apply this approach to herring spawning and harbor porpoise
   in the North Sea.},

Title = {Implications of applying cumulative risk assessment to the workplace},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {230-238},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Multiple changes are influencing work, workplaces and workers in the US
   including shifts in the main types of work and the rise of the `gig'
   economy. Work and workplace changes have coincided with a decline in
   unions and associated advocacy for improved safety and health
   conditions. Risk assessment has been the primary method to inform
   occupational and environmental health policy and management for many
   types of hazards. Although often focused on one hazard at a time, risk
   assessment frameworks and methods have advanced toward cumulative risk
   assessment recognizing that exposure to a single chemical or
   non-chemical stressor rarely occurs in isolation. We explore how
   applying cumulative risk approaches may change the roles of workers and
   employers as they pursue improved health and safety and elucidate some
   of the challenges and opportunities that might arise. Application of
   cumulative risk assessment should result in better understanding of
   complex exposures and health risks with the potential to inform more
   effective controls and improved safety and health risk management
   overall. Roles and responsibilities of both employers and workers are
   anticipated to change with potential for a greater burden of
   responsibility on workers to address risk factors both inside and
   outside the workplace that affect health at work. A range of policies,
   guidance and training have helped develop cumulative risk assessment for
   the environmental health field and similar approaches are available to
   foster the practice in occupational safety and health.},

Abstract = {To solve conservation and planning challenges in the marine environment,
   researchers are increasingly developing geospatial tools to address
   impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine biodiversity. The paper
   presents a comprehensive set of built-in geospatial webtools to support
   Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and environmental management objectives
   implemented into the Tools4MSP interoperable GeoPlatform. The webtools
   include cumulative effects assessment (CEA), maritime use conflict (MUC)
   analysis, MSFD pressure-driven CEA and a CEA-based marine ecosystem
   service threat analysis (MES-Threat). The tools are tested for the
   Northern Adriatic (NA) Sea, one of the most industrialized sea areas of
   Europe using a case study driven modelling strategy. Overall results
   show that coastal areas within 0-9 nm in the Gulf of Trieste,
   Grado-Marano and Venice lagoon and Po Delta outlet are subjected to
   intense cumulative effects and high sea use conflicts mainly from port
   activities, fishery, coastal and maritime tourism and maritime shipping.
   Linking MES into CEA provided novel information on locally threatened
   high MES supporting and provisioning habitats such Cymodocea beds and
   infralittoral fine sands, threats to cultural MES are most pronounced in
   coastal areas. Results are discussed for their geospatial relevance for
   regional planning, resource management and their applicability within
   MSP and environmental assessment.},

Abstract = {Cumulative impacts increasingly threaten marine and coastal ecosystems.
   To address this issue, the research community has invested efforts on
   designing and testing different methodological approaches and tools that
   apply cumulative impact appraisal schemes for a sound evaluation of the
   complex interactions and dynamics among multiple pressures affecting
   marine and coastal ecosystems.Through an iterative scientometric and
   systematic literature review, this paper provides the state of the art
   of cumulative impact assessment approaches and applications. It gives a
   specific attention to cutting-edge approaches that explore and model
   inter-relations among climatic and anthropogenic pressures,
   vulnerability and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems to these
   pressures, and the resulting changes in ecosystem services flow. Despite
   recent advances in computer sciences and the rising availability of big
   data for environmental monitoring and management, this literature review
   evidenced that the implementation of advanced complex system methods for
   cumulative risk assessment remains limited. Moreover, experts have only
   recently started integrating ecosystem services flow into cumulative
   impact appraisal frameworks, but more as a general assessment endpoint
   within the overall evaluation process (e.g. changes in the bundle of
   ecosystem services against cumulative impacts). The review also
   highlights a lack of integrated approaches and complex tools able to
   frame, explain, and model spatio-temporal dynamics of marine and coastal
   ecosystems' response to multiple pressures, as required under relevant
   EU legislation (e.g., Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework
   Directives). Progress in understanding cumulative impacts, exploiting
   the functionalities of more sophisticated machine learning-based
   approaches (e.g., big data integration), will support decisionmakers in
   the achievement of environmental and sustainability objectives.},

Title = {Same Space, Different Standards: A Review of Cumulative Effects
   Assessment Practice for Marine Mammals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Marine mammals are vulnerable to a variety of acute and chronic
   anthropogenic stressors, potentially experiencing these in isolation,
   successively and/or simultaneously. Formal assessment of the likely
   impact(s) of the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a defined
   population is carried out through a Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA),
   which is a mandatory component of the Environmental Impact Assessment
   (EIA) process in many countries. However, for marine mammals, the
   information required to feed into CEA, such as thresholds for
   disturbance, frequency of multiple (and simultaneous) exposures,
   interactions between stressors, and individual variation in response, is
   extremely limited, though our understanding is slowly improving. The
   gaps in knowledge make it challenging to effectively quantify and
   subsequently assess the risk of individual and population consequences
   of multiple disturbances in the form of a CEA. To assess the current
   state of practice for assessing cumulative effects on marine mammals
   within UK waters, 93 CEAs were reviewed across eleven maritime
   industries. An objective framework of thirteen evaluative criteria was
   used to score each assessment on a scale of 13-52 (weak - strong).
   Scores varied significantly by industry. On average, the aquaculture
   industry produced the lowest scoring CEAs, whilst the large offshore
   windfarm industry (>= 20 turbines) scored highest, according to the
   scoring criteria used. There was a significant increase in scores over
   the sample period (2009-2019), though this was mostly attributed to five
   industries (cable, large and small offshore wind farms, tidal and wave
   energy). There was inconsistency in the language used to define and
   describe cumulative effects and a lack of routinely applied methodology.
   We use the findings presented here, along with a wider review of the
   literature, to provide recommendations and discussion points aimed at
   supporting the standardisation and improvement of CEA practice. Although
   this research focused on how marine mammals were considered within UK
   CEAs, recommendations made are broadly applicable to assessments
   conducted for other receptors, countries and/or environments. Adoption
   of these proposals would help to ensure a more consistent approach, and
   would aid decision-makers and practitioners in mitigating any potential
   impacts, to ensure conservation objectives of marine mammal populations
   are not compromised.},

Title = {Framing future trajectories of human activities in the German North Sea
   to inform cumulative effects assessments and marine spatial planning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {349},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The global industrialization of seascapes and climate change leads to an
   increased risk of severe impacts on marine ecosystem functioning. While
   broad scale spatio-temporal assessments of human pressures on marine
   ecosystems become more available, future trajectories of human
   activities at regional and local scales remain often speculative. Here
   we introduce a stepwise process to integrate bottom-up and expert-driven
   approaches for scenario development to inform cumulative effects
   assessments and related marine spatial planning (MSP). Following this
   guidance, we developed optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenarios
   for major human pressures in the German North Sea such as bottom
   trawling, offshore wind, nutrient discharge, and aggregate extraction.
   The forecasts comprise quantitative estimates in relation to spatial
   footprint, intensity, and technological advancements of those pressures
   for the years 2030 and 2060. Using network analyses, we assessed
   interactions of the current and future trajectories of pressures thereby
   accounting for climate change and the growing need for marine
   conservation. Our results show that future scenarios of spatial
   distributions could be developed for activities that are spatially
   refined and included in the current MSP process. Further our detailed
   analyses of interdependencies of development components revealed that
   forecasts regarding specific targets and intensities of human activities
   depend also strongly on future technological advances. For fisheries and
   nutrient discharge estimates were less certain due to critical
   socio-ecological interactions in the marine and terrestrial realm.
   Overall, our approach unraveled such trade-offs and sources of
   uncertainties. Yet, our quantitative predictive scenarios were built
   under a sustainability narrative on a profound knowledge of interactions
   with other sectors and components in and outside the management
   boundaries. We advocate that they enable a better preparedness for
   future changes of cumulative pressure on marine ecosystems.},

Title = {Quality of federal level strategic environmental assessment - A case
   study analysis for transport, transmission grid and maritime spatial
   planning in Germany},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {41-59},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) emerged from Environmental
   Impact Assessment (ETA) and was developed based on the procedural steps
   and understanding thereof, but with the goal to fulfil a more
   `strategic' function. Federal level plans and programmes constitute the
   highest planning levels in Germany subject to SEA, as SEA for policies
   is not compulsory.
   In this article, we analyse the quality and procedural effectiveness of
   federal level SEA in Germany with the underlying hypothesis that federal
   level SEA might be more strategic than SEA at other planning levels, as
   it represents the highest tier. Therefore, we analysed three federal
   level SEA case studies in Germany according to a set of criteria and
   indicators based on international research outcomes, including SEA
   integration into decision making, tiering, scoping, selection and
   assessment of alternatives, cumulative effects assessment, public
   participation, and monitoring.
   Results demonstrate that the procedural effectiveness of SEA practice at
   the federal level is limited in Germany, and the making of SEAs proved
   not to be as `strategic' as its important role prior to subsequent
   planning processes and outcomes would suggest. Reasons include an
   alternatives assessment restricted to macro siting instead of assessing
   scenarios of demand or system alternatives, tiering limited to general
   advice without specific guidance for subsequent planning levels,
   cumulative effects assessment limited to intra-plan effects, a lack of
   monitoring, and public participation limited to consultation on the
   environmental report. These findings support results from a variety of
   international studies. Reasons for limitations have been identified in
   current SEA regulations, prior policy-making, institutional settings,
   the institutions' willingness to learn and limited quality management by
   the German Federal Environmental Agency. Thus, our recommendations aim
   to improve quality management and learning by initiating a federal level
   SEA forum to discuss federal level planning and SEA practice and related
   issues, expanding the federal EIA portal to SEAs, quality management by
   the German Federal Environmental Agency in every federal level SEA
   scoping process and for every federal level environmental report, and
   further research and development to improve SEA practice.
   However, the general question for SEA research might be whether SEA
   contributes to long-term institutional learning processes beyond
   individual SEA processes, and how those learning processes can be
   supported, for instance by quality management and capacity building.},

Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is a sub-discipline of environmental
   impact assessment that is concerned with appraising the collective
   effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment.
   Aspirations for CEA have been expressed by many authors since 1969, when
   the foundation of environmental appraisal was laid by the US National
   Environmental Policy Act. This paper's purposes are (i) to review
   aspirations for CEA, relative to current practice; and (ii) to fully
   explain and critique the logic that connects CEA's operational steps and
   underlying philosophies. A literature review supports the following
   statements: Some conceptualizations emphasize the delivery of
   information to support decision making as the key purpose of CEA; others
   deem collaboration, debate, and learning as most important. Consensus on
   CEA's operational steps has been reached, but each step requires
   practitioners to make analytical decisions (e.g., about the scope of
   issues to include or the time horizon to consider) and objective rules
   for how to approach those decisions are lacking. Numerical methods for
   assessing cumulative effects are largely available, meaning that CEA's
   biggest problems are not scientific. CEA cannot succeed without
   substantive public engagement, monitoring, and adaptive management. CEA
   is best undertaken regionally, rather than project-by-project. CEA and
   planning are complementary, and should be merged. In its most
   enlightened form, CEA is a useful tool for ensuring that human
   undertakings ultimately conform to Earth's finite biosphere, but current
   practice falls short of the ideal, and CEA's logical derivation is not
   entirely sound. As regards CEA's big problems, sustainability has not
   been defined clearly enough to make criteria for judging the
   significance of cumulative effects indisputable; legal, regulatory, and
   institutional frameworks are poorly aligned for CEA; and objective
   criteria for judging the adequacy of CEA's scope, scale, and thresholds
   do not exist, which makes the question of how to provide general
   guidance to practitioners intractable. Recommendations call for
   sustainability goals to be clearly expressed as measurable targets.
   Furthermore, precaution in human enterprise should be exercised by
   avoiding, minimizing, restoring, and offsetting negative cumulative
   effects. CEA can assist by quantifying and optimizing trade-offs.},

Abstract = {Social impacts resulting from policy changes and other interventions
   interact and aggregate, and are influenced by additional interventions
   and exogenous factors, leading to cumulative social impacts. We explored
   these complex impacts through a case study of forest policy changes
   introduced in the state of Western Australia between 1999 and 2004. In
   this process, we both drew on and modified the recently-proposed
   Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management (CEAM) framework, to
   improve its utility as an analytical tool for exploring cumulative
   social impacts that arise from policy changes in natural resource
   sectors. Our findings highlight the complexity of the pathways that lead
   to social impacts and the significant influence of individuals'
   responses. The findings also demonstrate the importance of considering
   cumulative impacts - negative and positive, and intended and unintended
   - when designing and implementing mitigation strategies, emphasizing the
   value of adaptive management approaches. Our results suggest that the
   CEAM framework, appropriately contextualized and adapted, is relevant to
   the assessment of social impacts associated with interventions in

Abstract = {There is a recognized need to advance cumulative effects assessment to
   regional and ecologically meaningful scales, but such initiatives are
   often critiqued for being isolated from management contexts and the
   regulatory practices of project-based environmental assessment. A major
   challenge is that there has been limited attention devoted to
   understanding decision-making at the project level, and the value of
   monitoring data to support cumulative effects analysis. This article
   examines how cumulative effects are considered during environmental
   assessment decision-making within the context of freshwater management
   in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories. Interviews with
   representatives from organizations involved in environmental assessment,
   regulation, and monitoring are used to identify challenges to applying
   information about cumulative effects at the project scale. Results
   reinforce the need for regional approaches and improvements in
   information and monitoring capacities to support cumulative effects
   analysis, but also the need to address institutional and organizational
   deficiencies to ensure that the data and information generated are
   useful to and applied within project-based decision-making.},

Abstract = {Published guidelines for Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA) have called
   for the identification of cause-and-effect relationships, or causality,
   challenging researchers to identify methods that can possibly meet CEA's
   specific requirements. Together with an outline of these requirements
   from CEA key literature, the various definitions of cumulative effects
   point to the direction of a method for causality analysis that is
   visually-oriented and qualitative. This article consequently revisits
   network and system diagrams, resolves their reported shortcomings, and
   extends their capabilities with causal loop diagramming methodology. The
   application of the resulting composite causality analysis method to
   three Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) case studies appears to
   satisfy the specific requirements of CEA regarding causality. Three
   ``moments{''} are envisaged for the use of the proposed method: during
   the scoping stage, during the assessment process, and during the
   stakeholder participation process. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential for collaborative governance
   approaches to support Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA) in the Cree
   territory of Eeyou Istchee, located in Northern Quebec, Canada, where a
   long history of large-scale hydroelectricity development, mining and
   forestry activities have negatively affected wildlife populations,
   imposing burdens on the traditional food systems and livelihoods of
   local Indigenous communities. Drawing on key informant interviews with
   policy actors from government, non-government and private sector
   organizations working on Impact Assessment in Eeyou Istchee, the
   potential for more decentralized and networked approaches to regional
   wildlife monitoring and baseline data collection in support of CEA is
   considered. Results suggest a shared willingness to collaborate towards
   improving the overall regional envi-ronmental conditions and to generate
   long-term data on wildlife population and distribution. Challenges
   include the absence of essential supporting programs (land-use plans,
   regional environmental frameworks, lead moni-toring agencies, designated
   funding), and high levels of distrust between proponents and NGOs which
   combine to suppress the initiation of collaborative governance processes
   as well as the potential utility of any regional monitoring program that
   might be established. The need for leadership to facilitate reciprocal
   knowledge flows among actors, build trust and enable long-term
   cooperative structures based on a shared vision and goal con-gruency is
   identified.},

Title = {Scientific dimensions of cumulative effects assessment: toward
   improvements in guidance for practice},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-52},
Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) became an increasingly important
   component of environmental impact assessment (EIA; or simply environment
   assessment (EA)) shortly after formal processes for EIA were established
   in North America in the 1970s. Despite a growing body of literature
   addressing science requirements of exemplary EIA and CEA, practice
   remains contested. Our mission in preparing this review was to provide a
   critical update on progress in scientific developments associated with
   CEA and also to guide practitioners to a broad selection of the recent
   relevant peer-reviewed formal literature on CEA. In addition, we point
   to ways in which guidance for CEA practice could be improved. The study
   canvassed widely for refereed papers in journals and edited books as far
   back as 2000. On the matter of key concepts related to CEA, the paper
   addresses the definition of other activities to be assessed,
   establishment of time and space bounds, impact thresholds, methods for
   impact prediction, and stressor-based versus effect-based approaches.
   Definitions of cumulative effect are reviewed, with encouragement for
   continued work to elaborate the concept. Contributions from science to
   CEA practice are identified as follows: retrospective and prospective
   investigative protocols; basic ecological knowledge; effects knowledge;
   tools and methods; ecological grounds for threshold establishment; and
   analytically competent practitioners. We observe that the plethora of
   CEA frameworks populating the scientific literature offer practitioners
   helpful ways to think about the CEA process. CEA methods are then
   reviewed, with specific emphasis on geographic information systems,
   scenario-building, thresholds, indicators, simulation, and public
   engagement. Several case examples of CEA in practice are summarized,
   with the observation that none of the published case studies arises from
   work done to support CEA that is part of the regulated EIA process. The
   paper reflects on the role of CEA in project-specific EIA (or project
   EA) as well as class EA, strategic EA, and regional EA. CEA is needed in
   all forms of EA, but it seems to be particularly difficult to implement
   well in project-specific EIAs. Recommendations for improvements in
   guidance materials for practitioners address definitions, scenarios,
   analytical methods, collaborative methods, thresholds, knowledge
   accumulation, accidents and malfunctions, project scale, and knowledge
   integration. We conclude that competent CEA is a vital requirement for
   securing the sustainability of valued ecosystems and their components.},

Title = {Consequences and implications of British Columbia's failed cumulative
   effects assessment and management framework for Indigenous peoples},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Legal challenges have played an important role in shaping the practices
   and policies of impact assessment (IA) for more than half a century.
   Early cases provided the impetus to the development of initial
   approaches upon which conventional cumulative effects assessment and
   management (CEAM) frameworks are based. Outcomes of these challenges,
   when examined from IA perspectives such as CEAM, often serve as
   important learning opportunities for jurisdictions updating policies and
   practices in addition to those considering (or needing to undergo) a
   paradigm shift. Failures and consequences identified therein and the
   associated implications provide important insights for both
   decision-makers and those adversely affected. This paper examines the
   Yahey v. British Columbia (2021) legal decision by a Canadian court that
   concluded British Columbia's provincial government failed to implement a
   credible CEAM framework and protect the cultural sustainability of
   Indigenous peoples. The paper summarises the deficiencies and
   consequences of the provincial CEAM framework based on the analysis that
   the court provided in its reasons for decision. These are followed by a
   critical viewpoint of the current practices concerning the key
   implications associated with the legal requisite to integrate the
   cultural ways of life into CEAM and IA more broadly. This discussion
   combines the extant literature with the findings and conclusions of the
   court. Each tier (i.e., policy, plan, programme, project) of
   environmental decision-making contributed to these failures, which makes
   the decision the most critical analysis and a potentially transformative
   ruling for project and regional assessments that involve Indigenous
   peoples.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) has been
   considered in Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) of regional and

   presents the legislative and regulatory requirements for assessing
   cumulative effects in plans and programmes in the UK. The two approaches
   for assessing plans in the UK, Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and SEA are
   discussed and in most cases, a combined SA and SEA process is undertaken
   by Regional and Local Planning Authorities. The strengths and weaknesses
   of this approach are explored, as well as their usefulness in decision
   making. There are problems relating to baseline, establishing trends and
   predicting cumulative effects at the strategic level. The issues in
   assessing cumulative effects within this SA/SEA framework are discussed
   and recommendations for improvements are made. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The case for including Integrated Land Management within forest
   management plans: An opinion},

Abstract = {An increasing human population is exerting greater demands upon the
   earth for resource production and living space. Despite its large
   landmass, Canada is not immune to this pressure. On industrial forested
   lands, one response has been integrated resource management, whereby the
   forest supports multiple uses within the same space and time. Under the
   strain of increasing pressures, coupled with a concern for the
   maintenance of natural systems and processes, it has become evident that
   the current planning processes need to evolve to incorporate a new land
   management paradigm. This paper outlines the issues and presents for
   discussion a potential management paradigm based not only on the limited
   scope of industrial forested lands but on the broader expanse of land
   management in general. Supporting the proposed Integrated Land
   Management (ILM) approach, Millar Western Forest Products Ltd., an
   Alberta-based forest products company, developed a cumulative effects
   assessment to complement its forest management plan. This assessment
   demonstrates that as a proof of concept, ILM is technically achievable
   and can be scientifically based. Further, integration of diverse
   concepts and disciplines can be organized to produce functional plans.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The implementation of marine spatial plans as required by the Directive
   on Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) of the European Union (EU) poses
   novel demands for the development of decision support tools (DST). One
   fundamental aspect is the need for tools to guide decisions about the
   allocation of human activities at sea in ways that are ecosystem-based
   and lead to sustainable use of resources. The MSP Directive was the main
   driver behind the development of spatial and non-spatial DSTs for the
   analysis of marine and coastal areas across European seas. In this
   research we develop an analytical framework designed by DST software
   developers and managers for the analysis of six DSTs supporting MSP in
   the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. The framework
   compares the main conceptual, technical and practical aspects, by which
   these DSTs contribute to advancing the MSP knowledge base and identified
   future needs for the development of the tools. Results show that all of
   the studied DSTs include elements to support ecosystem-based management
   at different geographical scales (from national to macro-regional),
   relying on cumulative effects assessment and functionalities to
   facilitate communication at the science-policy interface. Based on our
   synthesis we propose a set of recommendations for knowledge exchange in
   relation to further DST developments, mechanisms for sharing experience
   among the user-developer community, and actions to increase the
   effectiveness of the DSTs in MSP processes.},

Abstract = {The Almendares River watershed covers a large portion of Havana city.
   Human activities have negative impacts over it. We studied the
   alteration of biological processes in fish from polluted sites.
   Stressor-based cumulative effects assessment was applied at individual
   level in Gambusia puncticulata (Poey, 1854). Three sites of Almendares
   River were sampled monthly from July 2006 to June 2007. Length and
   weight of females, and condition factor for both sexes, were higher in
   the impacted sites. An increase of food supply due to eutrophication can
   explain why fishes are heavier and longer at polluted sites.
   Gonadosomatic, specific fecundity index and embryo numbers were
   significantly higher on the reference site. The Hepatosomatic index was
   higher in females from the most contaminated sites. Differences in delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 among contaminated and reference sites suggest that
   the food source is not the same. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (4): 1991-2004.

Abstract = {This paper explores the opportunities and constraints to project-based
   environmental assessment as a means to support the assessment and
   management of cumulative environmental effects. A case study of the
   hydroelectric sector is used to determine whether sufficient information
   is available over time through project-by-project assessments to support
   an adequate understanding of cumulative change. Results show
   inconsistency from one project to the next in terms of the components
   and indicators assessed, limited transfer of baseline information
   between project assessments over time, and the same issues and concerns
   being raised by review panels-even though the projects reviewed are
   operating in the same watershed and operated by the same proponent.
   Project environmental assessments must be managed, and coordinated, as
   part of a larger system of impact assessment, if project-by-project
   assessments are to provide a meaningful forum for learning and
   understanding cumulative change. The paper concludes with
   recommendations for improved project-based assessment practice in
   support of cumulative effects assessment and management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-283},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper examines the assessment of cumulative environmental impacts
   and the implementation of integrated coastal management within the
   harbour of Xiamen, China, an urban region in which the coastal zone is
   under increasing pressure as a result of very rapid economic growth. The
   first stage of analysis incorporates components of a cumulative effects
   assessment, including (a) identification of sources of environmental
   impacts, notably industrial expansion, port development, shipping, waste
   disposal, aquaculture and coastal construction, (b) selection of a set
   of valued ecosystem components, focusing on circulation and siltation,
   water quality, sediment, the benthic community' and mangrove forests,
   and (c) use of a set of key indicators to examine cumulative impacts
   arising from the aggregate of human activities. In the second stage of
   analysis, the paper describes and assesses the development of an
   institutional framework for integrated coastal management in Xiamen, one
   that combines policy and planning (including legislative and enforcement
   mechanisms) with scientific and monitoring mechanisms (including an
   innovative `marine functional zoning' system). The paper concludes that
   the integrated coastal management framework in Xiamen has met all
   relevant requirements for `integration' as laid out in the literature,
   and has explicitly incorporated consideration of cumulative impacts
   within its management and monitoring processes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {2018},
Volume = {635},
Pages = {1076-1080},

Abstract = {For the past two decades, the need to shield strategic maritime
   interests, to tackle criminality and terrorismat or from the sea and to
   conserve valuable marine resources has been recognized at the highest
   political level. Acknowledging and accounting for the interplay between
   climate change, the vulnerability of coastal populations and the
   occurrence of maritime criminality should be part of any ocean
   governance process. Still, given the complex interactions between
   climate change and socio-economic components of the marine realm, it has
   become urgent to establish a solid methodological framework, which could
   lead to sound and effective decisions. We propose that any such
   framework should not be built from scratch. The adaptation of well
   tested, existing uncertainty-management tools, such as Cumulative Effect
   Assessments, could serve as a solid basis to account for the magnitude
   and directionality of the dependencies between the impacts of climate
   change and the occurrence of maritime criminality, offering spatial
   explicit risk evaluations. Multi-Criteria Decision Making could then be
   employed to better and faster inform decision-makers. These mechanisms
   could provide a framework for comparison of alternative mitigation and
   adaptation actions and are essential in assessing responses to tackle
   maritime crime in the context of climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Looking Forward: Using Scenario Modeling to Support Regional Land Use
   Planning in Northern Yukon, Canada},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Regional land use planning provides opportunities for governments, land
   users, and stakeholders to consider multiple land and resource interests
   over large geographic areas and meaningful time periods. The broad and
   integrative nature of regional planning is therefore well suited to
   assessing the potential cumulative effects of current and future land
   use activity. For this reason, cumulative effects assessment models and
   management concepts are playing an increasingly important role in
   regional planning. We describe how the ALCES (R) landscape cumulative
   effects simulation model was used to explore possible outcomes of an oil
   and gas scenario in the Eagle Plain basin of the North Yukon Planning
   Region of Yukon Territory, Canada. Scenario modeling was conducted to
   facilitate informed discussion about key land use issues and practices,
   potential levels of landscape change, and possible socioeconomic
   benefits and environmental impacts. Modeling results supported the
   sustainable development and cumulative effects management
   recommendations of the North Yukon Regional Land Use Plan. Land use

Title = {A decision support tool for assessing cumulative effects on an Arctic
   migratory tundra caribou population},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {As large migratory caribou herds decline globally and regional climate
   trends point to a warmer future, there is a need and a legislative
   requirement to ensure impacts of industrial development are fully
   assessed, particularly with respect to cumulative effects. In this paper
   we use a current proposal, the potential leasing of the 1002 lands on
   the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
   for hydrocarbon development, to project the potential cumulative effects
   on the international Porcupine Caribou Herd. Using the caribou
   cumulative effects model, an existing decision support tool, we evaluate
   six alternative development scenarios for the 1002 lands, ranging from
   no leasing to full leasing with standard mitigation conditions. Compared
   to the no leasing option, at the current population size (218,000
   caribou), our analysis projected that the likelihood of a herd decline
   over a 10-year period would increase from 3\% to 19\% depending on the
   leasing scenarios analyzed. This compares to an increased probability of
   decline from 11\% to 26\% if the starting population was 100,000,
   indicative of population estimates in the early 1970s. Our approach
   accomplishes one of the main steps in a comprehensive cumulative effects
   assessment, namely the quantification of past, present, and foreseeable
   future projects on a valued ecosystem component, the Porcupine Caribou
   Herd. We suggest the testing of underlining assumptions and refinements
   of the model required to more fully estimate the impacts of development.
   The use of transparent, quantitative decision support tools in assessing
   industrial development impacts on Arctic wildlife becomes more critical
   as climatic changes to Arctic landscapes accelerate.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Species, habitats, and ecosystems are increasingly exposed to multiple
   anthropogenic stressors, fueling a rapidly expanding research program to
   understand the cumulative impacts of these environmental modifications.
   Since the 1970s, a growing set of methods has been developed through two
   parallel, sometimes connected, streams of research within the applied
   and academic realms to assess cumulative effects. Past reviews of
   cumulative effects assessment (CEA) methods focused on approaches used
   by practitioners. Academic research has developed several distinct and
   novel approaches to conducting CEA. Understanding the suite of methods
   that exist will help practitioners and academics better address various
   ecological foci (physiological responses, population impacts, ecosystem
   impacts) and ecological complexities (synergistic effects, impacts
   across space and time). We reviewed 6 categories of methods
   (experimental, meta-analysis, single-species modeling, mapping,
   qualitative modeling, and multispecies modeling) and examined the
   ability of those methods to address different levels of complexity. We
   focused on research gaps and emerging priorities. We found that no
   single method assessed impacts across the 4 ecological foci and 6
   ecological complexities considered. We propose that methods can be used
   in combination to improve understanding such that multimodel inference
   can provide a suite of comparable outputs, mapping methods can help
   prioritize localized models or experimental gaps, and future experiments
   can be paired from the outset with models they will inform.},

Title = {Threats to biodiversity from cumulative human impacts in one of North

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {672-684},

Abstract = {Land-use change is the largest proximate threat to biodiversity yet
   remains one of the most complex to manage. In British Columbia (BC),
   where large mammals roam extensive tracts of intact habitat, continued
   land-use development is of global concern. Extant mammal diversity in BC
   is unrivalled in North America owing, in part, to its unique position at
   the intersection of alpine, boreal, and temperate biomes. Despite high
   conservation values, understanding of cumulative ecological impacts from
   human development is limited. Using cumulative-effects-assessment (CEA)
   methods, we assessed the current human footprint over 16 regional
   ecosystems and 7 large mammal species. Using historical and current
   range estimates of the mammals, we investigated impacts of human land
   use on species' persistence. For ecosystems, we found that bunchgrass,
   coastal Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine have been subjected to over 50\%
   land-use conversion, and over 85\% of their spatial extent has undergone
   either direct or estimated indirect impacts. Of the mammals we
   considered, wolves were the least affected by land conversion, yet all
   species had reduced ranges compared with historical estimates. We found
   evidence of a hard trade-off between development and conservation, most
   clearly for mammals with large distributions and ecosystems with high
   levels of conversion. Rather than serve as a platform to monitor species
   decline, we strongly advocate these data be used to inform land-use
   planning and to assess current conservation efforts. More generally,
   CEAs offer a robust tool to inform wildlife and habitat conservation at
   scale.},

Abstract = {In Canada, the assessment of cumulative effects, incremental and
   accumulating environmental changes in a region over time, emerged from
   environmental impact assessment, which was designed to serve the ethos
   of western, `settler' governments despite being practiced in areas that
   usually overlap Indigenous territories. The limited (western) purview of
   cumulative effects assessment is reinforced by a lack of diversity in
   water monitoring and management practitioners. Our objective is to
   develop a new approach, collaborative watershed analysis, in which
   diverse ways of knowing are considered in the assessment of cumulative
   effects in water quality monitoring. An online workshop and 21
   interviews informed how Canadian water managers, community members, and
   Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) peoples may collaborate to assess cumulative
   effects in the lower Grand River and the nearshore of Lake Erie (eastern
   basin in Ontario, Canada). Our results and discussion progress from
   western perspectives of `what is' to a broader discussion of `what could
   be', drawing on the perspectives of Haudenosaunee youth in the Grand
   River Watershed. We propose three recommendations for the creation of a
   cumulative effects monitoring framework: (1) co-create the intent and
   expectations of the monitoring program with all participants at the
   outset; (2) ensure diverse persons are invited to contribute; and (3)
   enable the sharing of knowledge in different formats. Strengths of
   collaborative watershed analysis include connecting biophysical aspects
   of the watershed with social, economic, and cultural aspects, as well as
   repositioning diverse ways of knowing as a foundation upon which
   cumulative impacts can be better understood and managed. (c) 2022 The

Title = {A risk-based approach to cumulative effects assessment for large marine
   ecosystems to support transboundary marine spatial planning: A case
   study of the yellow sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {342},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) should be conducted at ecologically
   meaningful scales such as large marine ecosystems to halt further ocean
   degradation caused by anthropogenic pressures and facilitate
   ecosystem-based management such as transboundary marine spatial planning
   (MSP). However, few studies exist at large marine ecosystems scale,
   especially in the West Pacific seas, where countries have different MSP
   processes yet trans-boundary cooperation is paramount. Thus, a step-wise
   CEA would be informative to help bordering countries set a common goal.
   Building on the risk-based CEA framework, we decomposed CEA into risk
   identification and spatially-explicit risk analysis and applied it to
   the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (YSLME), aiming to understand the
   most influential cause-effect pathways and risk distribution pattern.
   The results showed that (1) seven human activities including port,
   mariculture, fishing, industry and urban development, shipping, energy,
   and coastal defence, and three pressures including physical loss of
   seabed, input of hazardous substances, ni-trogen, and phosphorus
   enrichment were the leading causes of environmental problems in the
   YSLME; (2) benthic organisms, fishes, algae, tidal flats, seabirds, and
   marine mammals were the most vulnerable ecosystem components on which
   cumulative effects acted; (3) areas with relatively high risk mainly
   concentrated on nearshore zones, especially Shandong, Liaoning, and
   northern Jiangsu, while coastal bays of South Korea also witnessed high
   risk; (4) certain risks could be observed in the transboundary area, of
   which the causes were the pervasive fishing, shipping, and sinking of
   pollutants in this area due to the cyclonic circulation and fine-grained
   sediments. In future transboundary cooperation on MSP, risk criteria and
   evaluation of existing management measures should be incorporated to
   determine whether the identified risk has exceeded the acceptable level
   and identify the next step of cooperation. Our study presents an example
   of CEA at large marine ecosystems scale and provides a reference to
   other large marine ecosystems in the West Pacific and elsewhere.},

   land-based management with marine spatial planning},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {787},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Cumulative impact assessments can inform ecosystem-based management by
   mapping human pressures and assessing their intensity on ecosystem
   components. However, its use to inform local management is scarce,
   largely due to the need for fine-grained spatial data representing
   ecosystem threats that can assess impacts at a local scale. Here, we
   applied the cumulative impact assessment framework to Moorea's coral
   reef, French Polynesia to inform the ongoing revision of the island-wide
   marine spatial management plan. We combined high spatial resolution data
   on 11 local anthropogenic pressures and four ecological components with
   expert vulnerability assessments. Results revealed that the entire reef
   is impacted by at least four pressures: coral reef fisheries,
   agriculture, land use change and urbanization. These activities together
   contribute to 87\% of the overall cumulative impact. Most importantly,
   land-based activities contribute to more than half (52\%) of the overall
   impact. Other high-impact activities, such as reef-based tourism, remain
   very localized and contribute little to the overall human impact. These
   findings show that by focusing solely on reef-based activities, the
   current management plan misses critical sources of impact. Not
   considering land-based activities in the management may lead to
   decisions that could fail to significantly lower cumulative human impact
   on the reef. This study demonstrates how operationalizing the cumulative
   human impact framework at a local scale can help managers identify key
   leverage points likely to yield improved ecological outcomes.

Title = {Institutional arrangements for assessing and managing cumulative effects

Journal = {CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {223-236},
Abstract = {Assessing and managing cumulative effects on watersheds involves
   numerous agencies, regulatory frameworks and jurisdictions, and
   necessitates the co-creation of new, or innovations in existing,
   institutional arrangements. This paper examines the institutional
   arrangements needed to implement and sustain cumulative effects
   assessment and management (CEAM) for watersheds. The study is based on
   semi-structured interviews with 29 key informants in the Grand River
   watershed, Canada, including members from academia, government agencies,
   consulting firms, non-governmental organizations, and First Nations,
   with knowledge of, and direct experience in, watershed planning,
   assessment and monitoring. The research explored governance conditions
   in the watershed based on a framework of CEAM requisites developed from
   other watersheds where institutional arrangements have been
   investigated. Results indicate the need for improved institutional
   arrangements in the Grand River watershed to support the development of
   watershed CEAM, namely: a combined law-policy approach to implement
   CEAM, yet ensuring sensitivity to watershed context; a strong mandate
   for CEAM leadership and the capacity to coordinate CEAM initiatives; and
   tiering of CEAM planning, monitoring and assessment initiatives as a
   means to strengthen nested governance structures.},

Abstract = {The growth of unconventional shale gas development has been accompanied
   by controversy over its environmental and social impacts. This paper
   reviews recent literature to clarify what is known and not known about
   the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of the process
   chemicals and wastewaters generated in hydraulic fracturing, the
   mechanisms and pathways by which they enter surface water and
   groundwater aquifers and the risks posed to human and ecosystem health.
   Assessing the impacts of unconventional shale gas development is clearly
   constrained by a lack of baseline information, complex hydrogeological
   histories for natural migration of hydrocarbons, lack of tracers to
   monitor and verify the source, timing and mechanism of contaminant
   migration into water resources. This is compounded by lack of
   transparency and accountability in policy decisions. The paper argues
   that managing the social and environmental risks of unconventional shale
   gas development calls for a new generation of impact assessment, one
   that marries the ideals of strategic environmental assessment,
   cumulative effects assessment, backcasting and deliberative and
   inclusive processes of community engagement towards collective risk
   management.},

   Environmental Effects and Risk-Based Regulation},
Journal = {QUEENS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2},
Pages = {705-740},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This article considers when and how the ancient common law maxim de
   minimis non curat lex-the law does not concern itself with trifling
   matters-ought to be applied in Canadian environmental law. These
   questions are important because their answers determine whether conduct
   that results in a seemingly minor level of environmental harm will-or
   will not-be subject to a given regulatory regime, which in turn creates
   the potential for environmental degradation through cumulative effects.
   Part I observes that there is considerable confusion about whether the
   maxim is ever applicable in the Canadian environmental law context, but
   concludes that it is applicable in certain legislative circumstances.
   Part II argues that the prevailing conception of de minimis as a
   single-step test concerned only with the magnitude of environmental harm
   in isolation is incorrect; rather, the foundational jurisprudence points
   to a two-step test that considers the potential for cumulative effects.
   This Part also examines recent developments in cumulative effects
   assessment and the emerging paradigm of risk-based regulation in order
   to shed some modern light on this ancient maxim's application. The
   article concludes by considering the implications of applying de minimis
   in this way for regulators, industry and the public.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {The North Sea basin is one of the busiest maritime areas globally with a
   considerable number of anthropogenic pressures impacting the functioning
   of the marine ecosystem. Due to growing EU ambitions for the deployment
   of large offshore wind farm projects (OWF), as part of the 2050
   renewable energy roadmap, there is a key need for a holistic
   understanding of OWF potential impacts on the marine ecosystem. We
   propose a holistic Cumulative Effect Assessment methodology, applied
   using a geo-spatial open-source software, to assess impacts of OWF
   related pressures on selected seabed habitats, fish, seabird and mammal
   species. We take into account pressures specific to the three OWF
   development phases, spanning 1999-2050, for the entire North Sea basin.
   Our results underline 2022 as the peak year of cumulative impacts for
   the approved OWFs, followed by a considerable increase in potential
   impacts of the planned 212GWs, by 2050. The spatio-temporal analysis of
   the OWF environmental impacts presents the shift between highly impacted
   areas over the studied timeline and distinguishes between concentrated
   areas of high impacts (S-E of UK) and dispersed areas of high impacts
   (Germany). Our results can inform decision-makers and the OWF industry
   in a joint effort to mitigate the environmental impacts of future large
   OWF developments.},

   framework: An Adriatic case study},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {193},

Abstract = {Multiple anthropogenic activities can exert adverse effects on marine
   vulnerable ecological components and the ecosystem services they provide
   to human well-being. Emilia-Romagna (E-R) Region belongs to one of the
   most industrialized coastal and sea areas of the Italian Northern
   Adriatic Sea, requiring adequate decision support instruments able to
   assist authorities to enforce ecosystem-based Marine Spatial Planning
   (MSP). In this research we combine Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA)
   model with marine ecosystem services capacity (MESCap) assessment of
   multiple ecological components (seabed habitats, essential fish
   habitats, marine mammals and turtles). The geospatial instruments were
   used for E-R Region's sea space to support the selection of spatially
   explicit measures to address two marine conservation objectives, i.e. A.
   preservation of essential fish habitats and B. protection of species of
   high conservation value, namely marine mammals and turtles, proposed
   within an MSP pilot study for the region. Results show that cumulative
   effects are mainly generated from trawling activities, maritime
   transport (e.g. Port of Ravenna), and by the influence of land-based
   activities (i.e. inputs from Po river and other minor rivers). Highest
   threats to marine ecosystem services (ES) were related to supporting ES
   (e.g. habitat and nursery provisioning) and to cultural ES. We discuss
   the contribution of the presented approach towards an ecosystem-based
   management in the region and the potential benefits that the integration
   of the ES concept can have in the designing of planning measures with
   the aim of reducing the cumulative effects and of maintaining marine
   ecological resources and services.},

Title = {Cumulative effects of multiple stressors impact an endangered seagrass
   population and fish communities},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {904},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are becoming increasingly threatened by human
   activities and there is growing appreciation that management must
   consider the impacts of multiple stressors. Cumulative effects
   assessments (CEAs) have become a popular tool for identifying the
   distribution and intensity of multiple human stressors in coastal
   ecosystems. Few studies, however, have demonstrated strong correlations
   between CEAs and change in ecosystem condition, questioning its
   management use. Here, we apply a CEA to the endangered seagrass
   Posidonia australis in Pittwater, NSW, Australia, using spatial data on
   known stressors to seagrass related to foreshore development, water
   quality, vessel traffic and fishing. We tested how well cumulative
   effects scores explained changes in P. australis extent measured between
   2005 and 2019 using high-resolution aerial imagery. A negative
   correlation between P. australis and estimated cumulative effects scores
   was observed (R2 = 22 \%), and we identified a threshold of cumulative
   effects above which losses of P. australis became more likely. Using
   baited remote underwater video, we surveyed fishes over P. australis and
   non-vegetated sediments to infer and quantify how impacts of cumulative
   effects to P. australis extent would flow on to fish assemblages. P.
   australis contained a distinct assemblage of fish, and on non-vegetated
   sediments the abundance of sparids, which are of importance to
   fisheries, increased with closer proximity to P. australis. Our results
   demonstrate the negative impact of multiple stressors on P. australis
   and the consequences for fish biodiversity and fisheries production
   across much of the estuary. Management actions aimed at reducing or
   limiting cumulative effects to low and moderate levels will help
   conserve P. australis and its associated fish biodiversity and
   productivity.},

Abstract = {Climate change (CC) is a key, global driver of change of marine
   ecosystems. At local and regional scales, other local human stressors
   (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems.
   Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined
   effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based
   management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of
   such interactions is fragmented.
   At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs)
   have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and
   shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic
   review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological
   organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined
   effect of CC and HS.
   Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the
   marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial
   fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal
   fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien
   species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At
   trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either
   intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the
   trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting
   that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary
   among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale
   assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS
   remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need
   of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate
   climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying
   management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant
   scales. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Climate is changing at an unprecedented rate with impacts being felt in
   social and ecological systems around the world. Opportunities for
   building climate resilience of the social-ecological system surrounding
   freshwater areas are assessed using the aquatic monitoring and reporting
   programs of Muskoka River Watershed (Ontario, Canada) as a case study. A
   three-step study design was used: establishment of a knowledge baseline
   (i.e., what has been done), confirmation of the baseline to ensure
   perspectives that emerged were inclusive of multiple stakeholders (i.e.,
   broadly applicable) and an exploratory workshop to disseminate
   recommendations and discuss implementation with key stakeholders. Two
   themes are discussed: the strengthening of watershed-scale monitoring
   approaches, and improved communication with stakeholders (e.g., through
   `state of the watershed' reporting). This study offers an evaluation of
   watershed-scale aquatic monitoring and reporting and provides concrete
   examples from the case study. We test a new process for refining,
   selecting, or prioritizing indicators for aquatic monitoring. Cumulative
   effects assessment and monitoring (CEAM) is considered as the suggested
   monitoring approach at a watershed-scale. Recommendations for developing
   CEAM in the Muskoka River Watershed include considerations for selection
   of monitoring indicators, consistent communication of indicators, and
   implementing a metadatabase. Ways to enhance education of, and
   engagement with, local stakeholders through improved `state of the
   watershed' report cards are highlighted. Resilience is strengthened by
   addressing two goals in the case study: engaging with the community and
   improving knowledge of stressor-effect relationships in the watershed
   via stronger aquatic monitoring.},

Abstract = {The design and implementation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   are often hampered by high financial costs, significant time commitment,
   and biases due to researchers' familiarity with studies. We proposed and

   Python packaged dubbed Ananse, which is benchmarked on the search terms
   strategy for naive search proposed by Grames et al. (2019) written in
   ``R{''}. Ananse was applied to a case example towards finding search
   terms to implement a systematic literature review on cumulative effect
   studies on forest ecosystems.center dot The software automatically
   corrected and classified 100\% of the duplicate articles identified by
   manual deduplication. Ananse was applied to the cumulative effects
   assessment case study, but it can serve as a general-purpose,
   open-source software system that can support extensive systematic
   reviews within a relatively short period with reduced biases.center dot
   Besides generating keywords, Ananse can act as middleware or a data
   converter for integrating multiple datasets into a database. Crown

Title = {Evaluation of a popular spatial cumulative impact assessment method for
   marine systems: A seagrass case study},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {780},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Human activities put stress on our oceans and with a growing global
   population, the impact is increasing. Stressors rarely act in isolation,
   with the majority of marine areas being impacted by multiple, concurrent
   stressors. Marine spatial cumulative impact assessments attempt to
   estimate the collective impact of multiple stressors on marine
   environments. However, this is difficult given how stressors interact
   with one another, and the variable response of ecosystems. As a result,
   assumptions and generalisations are required when attempting to model
   cumulative impacts. One fundamental assumption of the most commonly
   applied, semi quantitative cumulative impact assessment method is that a
   change in modelled cumulative impact is correlated with a change in
   ecosystem condition. However, this assumption has rarely been validated
   with empirical data. We tested this assumption using a case study of
   seagrass in a large, inverse estuary in South Australia (Spencer Gulf).
   We compared three different seagrass condition indices, based on survey
   data collected in the field, to scores from a spatial cumulative impact
   model for the study area. One condition index showed no relationship
   with cumulative impact, whilst the other two indices had very small,
   negative relationships with cumulative impact. These results suggest
   that one of the most commonly used methods for assessing cumulative
   impacts on marine systems is not robust enough to accurately reflect the
   effect of multiple stressors on seagrasses; possibly due to the number
   and generality of assumptions involved in the approach. Future methods
   should acknowledge the complex relationships between stressors, and the
   impact these relationships can have on ecosystems. This outcome
   highlights the need for greater evaluation of cumulative impact
   assessment outputs and the need for data-driven approaches. Our results
   are a caution for marine scientists and resource managers who may rely
   on spatial cumulative impact assessment outputs for informing policy and
   decision-making. Crown Copyright

Title = {Capturing expert uncertainty in spatial cumulative impact assessments},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of human impacts on marine
   environments is necessary for maintaining healthy ecosystems and
   supporting `blue economies'. Realistic assessments of impact must
   consider the cumulative impacts of multiple, coincident threats and the
   differing vulnerabilities of ecosystems to these threats. Expert
   knowledge is often used to assess impact in marine ecosystems because
   empirical data are lacking; however, this introduces uncertainty into
   the results. As part of a spatial cumulative impact assessment for
   Spencer Gulf, South Australia, we asked experts to estimate score ranges
   (best-case, most-likely and worst-case), which accounted for their
   uncertainty about the effect of 32 threats on eight ecosystems. Expert
   scores were combined with data on the spatial pattern and intensity of
   threats to generate cumulative impact maps based on each of the three
   scoring scenarios, as well as simulations and maps of uncertainty. We
   compared our method, which explicitly accounts for the experts'
   knowledge-based uncertainty, with other approaches and found that it
   provides smaller uncertainty bounds, leading to more constrained
   assessment results. Collecting these additional data on experts'
   knowledge-based uncertainty provides transparency and simplifies
   interpretation of the outputs from spatial cumulative impact
   assessments, facilitating their application for sustainable resource
   management and conservation.},

Title = {IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND ROAD PLANNING AT THE
   LANDSCAPE SCALE},
Booktitle = {HANDBOOK OF ROAD ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Pages = {32-42},
Abstract = {There is increasing concern about insufficient consideration of
   potential ecological effects of roads in project-specific environmental
   impact assessment (ETA) and other, more advanced types of ETA that exist
   in various countries. Local impacts are often treated superficially, and
   landscape-scale effects are usually neglected.
   5.1 EIAs of road projects are generally poor.
   5.2 Landscape-scale effects of road networks are neglected in EIAs.
   5.3 There is a lack of knowledge of thresholds in the cumulative effects
   of landscape fragmentation and habitat loss on the viability of wildlife
   populations.
   5.4 Wildlife populations may have long response times to increases in
   landscape fragmentation ('extinction debt').
   5.5 There are large uncertainties about many potential ecological
   effects of roads; they need explicit consideration in EIA. and
   decision-makers should more rigorously apply the precautionary
   principle.
   5.6 Landscape fragmentation should be monitored because it is a threat
   to biodiversity and a relevant pressure indicator.
   5.7 Maintaining ecological corridor networks is less costly than paying
   for their restoration at a later date.
   5.8 Limits to control landscape fragmentation are needed.
   5.9 Caring about the quality of the entire landscape is essential, not
   just protected areas and wildlife corridors.
   Major efforts are necessary to improve the quality of project-specific
   EIAs, landscape-scale cumulative effect assessment (CEA), strategic
   environmental assessment (SEA), road planning, and land-use planning.
   Given that road networks subdivide wildlife populations into a patchwork
   of sub-populations, futuro studies should directly address ecological
   effects at the landscape scale.},

Title = {Combining seascape connectivity with cumulative impact assessment in
   support of ecosystem-based marine spatial planning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {576-586},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is a promising approach to guide
   marine spatial planning (MSP) and management. One limitation of CIA is
   the neglect of seascape connectivity, which may spread the impact of
   localized pressures to ambient areas, e.g. through lost dispersal and
   recruitment of organisms.
   We here, for the first time, incorporate seascape connectivity into a
   traditional CIA model using a connectivity matrix, exemplified by
   dispersal of propagules estimated through biophysical modelling. Two
   connectivity impacts are identified: the source impact represents
   downstream areas losing recruits because of reduced larval dispersal
   from sites affected by the pressure, and the sink impact represents loss
   of recruits originating from upstream areas prevented from settlement in
   the site affected by the local pressure.
   By including seascape connectivity in the Swedish MSP-guiding CIA tool
   Symphony we demonstrate how to practically account for remote effects of
   local environmental impact. Our example on blue mussel shows how
   reducing mussel fitness in a given area may have impacts on mussels far
   from the acting pressures. Overall, results indicate that connectivity
   impact for blue mussels plays a minor role in most areas, <10\% of the
   ordinary cumulative impact. However, in some smaller areas, e.g. on
   offshore banks and the Danish Straits, seascape connectivity may
   increase ordinary cumulative impact with 20\%-30\%. In an example of
   scenario-based CIA analyses of MSP projections, we demonstrate how
   impacts of particular management actions, e.g. shipping rerouting and
   wind power developments, can be tracked far from the original area of
   influence.
   Depending on the dispersal ability of ecosystem components, a local
   pressure may impact a considerable area through seascape connectivity,
   transgressing management units and national borders. Although the mean
   connectivity impact may be modest for a single ecosystem component, the
   consideration of seascape connectivity across multiple ecosystem
   components may significantly alter the mapping of cumulative impact and
   the assessment of different MSP scenarios.
   Synthesis and applications. Our extension of Cumulative Impact
   Assessment offers a new method for mapping and practically integrating
   seascape connectivity with ecosystem-based MSP and other spatial
   instruments for policy making, such as marine protected areas.},

Abstract = {Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) examine potential risks posed by
   exposure to multiple and sometimes disparate environmental stressors.
   CRAs are more resource intensive than single chemical assessments, and
   pose additional challenges and sources of uncertainty. CRAs may examine
   the impact of several factors on risk, including exposure magnitude and
   timing, chemical mixture composition, as well as physical, biological,
   or psychosocial stressors. CRAs are meant to increase the relevance of
   risk assessments, providing decision makers with information based on
   real world exposure scenarios that improve the characterization of
   actual risks and hazards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
   evaluated a number of CRAs, performed by or commissioned for the Agency,
   to seek insight into CRA concepts, methods, and lessons learned. In this
   article, ten case studies and five issue papers on key CRA topics are
   examined and a set of lessons learned are identified for CRA
   implementation. The lessons address the iterative nature of CRAs,
   importance of considering vulnerability, need for stakeholder
   engagement, value of a tiered approach, new methods to assess multiroute
   exposures to chemical mixtures, and the impact of geographical scale on
   approach and purpose. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Delineating priority areas for highly mobile marine megafauna represents
   a major challenge for conservation biology. To manage such areas, one
   must understand both their spatial properties (i.e., location, number,
   extent), and the level of exposure to a number of given pressures. Here,
   we used a combination of ensemble distribution models, field-based
   validation methods and a cumulative effect assessment to illustrate key
   foraging sites and risk hotspots for adult loggerhead sea turtles,
   Caretta caretta, in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that foraging sites
   covered about 10\% of the neritic zone of the Mediterranean basin. We
   identified sites which are well recognized by scientists, but also other
   areas for which our knowledge on the potential importance is limited.
   The patterns of the habitat use generated by field data validated the
   accuracy of the distribution model. About one fifth of the foraging
   areas hosted in the Mediterranean could be considered as hotspots of
   risk, characterized by high or very high exposure to cumulative
   pressures. Our results suggest that management and conservation efforts
   should continue to be held at key, well-known foraging grounds of adult
   sea turtles (e.g., Northern Adriatic Sea, Tunisian Plateau) but there
   are several more potential sites (e.g., parts of the Aegean Sea and the
   Western Mediterranean) which deserve our attention in order to ensure
   viable populations.},

Title = {Migration Corridors and Threats in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
   Straits for Loggerhead Sea Turtles},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Along migration corridors, animals can face natural and anthropogenic
   threats that differ from those in breeding and non-breeding residence
   areas. Satellite telemetry can aid in describing the timing and location
   of these migrations. We use this tool with switching state-space
   modeling and line kernel density estimates to identify migration
   corridors of post-nesting adult female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta
   caretta, n = 89 tracks) that nested at five beaches in the Gulf of
   Mexico. Turtles migrated in both neritic and oceanic areas of the Gulf
   of Mexico with some exiting the Gulf. High-use migration corridors were
   found in neritic areas to the west of Florida and also in the Florida
   Straits. Repeat tracking of post-nesting migrations for eight turtles
   showed variability in track overlap, ranging from similar to 13 to 82\%
   of tracks within 10 km of each other. Migration primarily occurred in
   July and August. We document the longest known post-nesting migration
   to-date of a wild adult female loggerhead of >4,300 km, along with an
   apparent stopover of about 1 month. Migration corridors overlaid on
   three spatially explicit anthropogenic threats (shipping density,
   commercial line fishing, and shrimp trawling) showed hotspots in the
   Florida Straits, off the northwest Florida coast and off the coast of
   Tampa Bay. Identifying where and at what intensity multiple human
   activities and natural processes most likely occur is a key goal of
   Cumulative Effects Assessments. Our results provide the scientific
   information needed for designing management strategies for this
   threatened species. Information about this loggerhead migration corridor
   can also be used to inform adaptive management as threats shift over
   time.},

Abstract = {Phthalates strongly and adversely affect reproduction, development and
   liver function. We did a cumulative risk assessment for simultaneous
   exposure to nine phthalates using the hazard index (HI) and the levels
   of nine phthalates in 1200 foodstuff samples. DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl
   phthalate) present the highest level (mean: 0.443 mg/kg) in 1200
   samples, and the highest average daily dose (ADD) was found in DEHP,
   Sigma DBP(i + n) (the sum of dibutyl phthalate {[}DBP] isomers {[}DnBP +
   DiBP]) posed the highest risk potential of all the phthalates. In seven
   phthalates, the 95th percentiles of the ADDs for Sigma DBP(i + n) in
   0-6-yr-old children accounted for 91\% (79-107\%) of the tolerable daily
   intake, and the 95th percentiles of the HIs for the anti-androgenic
   effects of five phthalates in 0-3-yr-old children and 4-6-yr-old girls
   were >1. We conclude that the health of younger Taiwanese may be
   adversely affected by overexposure of phthalate-contaminated foods. (C)

Title = {Additive and interactive cumulative effects on boreal landbirds: winners
   and losers in a multi-stressor landscape},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Stressors created by multiple resource industries can result in
   cumulative effects over time and space. Many studies have evaluated
   single stressors and assumed that cumulative effects can be understood
   by adding stressors together. However, there is growing evidence that
   interactive effects are important in structuring biological communities.
   We evaluated whether the effects of multiple stressors in the boreal
   forest (linear features, energy, forestry) combine additively or
   interactively by testing a candidate model set of 12 cumulative effects
   models of abundance for 27 landbird species. We fitted paired additive
   and interactive Generalized Additive Models and examined model
   predictions in the Athabasca Oil Sands Area of Alberta, Canada, and a
   theoretical no-disturbance version of the study area. Of the 27 species
   examined, an additive disturbance model was the best for nine species,
   while an interactive disturbance model was the best for 11 species. In
   the current study area, disturbance models predicted strong increases in
   abundance for species associated with deciduous forest and open habitats
   (winning species) and moderate decreases for species associated with
   conifer forest (losing species). We found a 15\% change in landbird
   community composition between the current study area, with 8.4\%
   disturbance, and the theoretical no-disturbance study area. Complex
   synergistic and antagonistic interactions among stressors were observed
   for 39\% of landbird species, with the majority of interactions observed
   being synergistic. Stressors with relatively small disturbance areas,
   such as narrow linear disturbances, frequently interacted with other
   stressors to affect species' responses, and energy sector stressors
   often had additive or interactive effects with forestry stressors.
   Interactive cumulative effects from multiple sectors will make it
   increasingly difficult for industry and land managers to manage impacts
   unless interactions among stressors are incorporated into cumulative
   effects assessments and regional land use planning processes.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of hydraulic fracturing wastewater practices in

Journal = {CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {122-137},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper is the second in a two-part series that assesses and
   summarizes extant knowledge regarding hydraulic fracturing wastewater
   management using a comparative, multidisciplinary approach. This study
   compares the regulatory regimes related to wastewater handling (storage
   and transport), treatment and disposal practices as they apply to the
   hydraulic fracturing industry in four unconventional shale plays in
   North America: the Montney in British Columbia (BC), the Duvernay in
   Alberta (AB), the Marcellus in the northeastern United States (US) and
   the Barnett in Texas. In North America, handling, treatment and disposal
   practices in the regulation of oil and gas wastewater is complex and
   multifaceted due to shared jurisdiction over many aspects across
   provincial or state lines, and/or across provincial/state and federal
   levels. All jurisdictions considered in this assessment have highly
   specific regulations for many elements of wastewater handling, treatment
   and disposal. However, much of the guidance for these practices comes
   from other legislation that makes provisions for environmental or safety
   performance, or prohibitions against pollution. The research suggests
   that knowledge gaps exist in the areas of regulatory outcomes, and
   compliance and best management practices, particularly in how those
   factors enable and constrain environmentally sustainable practices. BC's
   area-based-management model and AB's play-based-regulation pilot project
   are examples of attempted cumulative effects assessment and management
   noticeably absent from the Marcellus or Barnett plays.},

Title = {Causal inference in cumulative risk assessment: The roles of directed
   acyclic graphs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) address exposures to multiple
   chemical and nonchemical stressors and often focus on characterization
   of health risks in vulnerable populations. Evaluating complex
   exposure-response relationships in CRAs requires the use of formal and
   rigorous methods for causal inference. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
   are graphical causal models used to organize and communicate knowledge
   about the underlying causal structure that generates observable data.
   Using existing graphical theories for causal inference with DAGs, risk
   analysts can identify confounders and effect measure modifiers to
   determine if the available data are both internally valid to obtain
   unbiased risk estimates and are generalizable to populations of
   interest. Conditional independencies implied by the structure of a DAG
   can be used to test assumptions used in a CRA against empirical data in
   a selected study and can contribute to the evidence evaluations related
   to specific causal pathways. This can facilitate quantitative use of
   these data, as well as help identify key research gaps, prioritize data
   collection activities, and evaluate risk management alternatives. DAGs
   also enable risk analysts to be explicit about sources of uncertainty
   and to determine whether a causal effect can be estimated from available
   data. Using a conceptual model and DAG for a hypothetical community
   located near a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), we
   illustrate the advantages of using DAGs for evaluating causality in
   CRAs. DAGs also can be used in conjunction with weight of evidence (WOE)
   methodology to improve causal analysis for CRA, which could lead to more
   effective interventions to reduce population health risks. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Wildlife models focused solely on a single strong influence (e.g.,
   habitat components, wildlife harvest) are limited in their ability to
   detect key mechanisms influencing population change. Instead, we propose
   integrated modeling in the context of cumulative effects assessment
   using multispecies population dynamics models linked to
   landscape-climate simulation at large spatial and temporal scales. We
   developed an integrated landscape and population simulation model using
   ALCES Online as the model-building platform, and the model accounted for
   key ecological components and relationships among moose (Alces alces),
   grey wolves (Canis lupus nubilus), and woodland caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus caribou) in northern Ontario, Canada. We simulated multiple
   scenarios over 5 decades (beginning 2020) to explore sensitivity to
   climate change and land use and assessed effects at multiple scales. The
   magnitude of effect and the relative importance of key factors (climate
   change, roads, and habitat) differed depending on the scale of
   assessment. Across the full extent of the study area (654,311km(2)
   {[}ecozonal scale]), the caribou population declined by 26\% largely
   because of climate change and associated predator-prey response, which
   led to caribou range recession in the southern part of the study area.
   At the caribou range scale (108,378 km(2)), which focused on 2 herds in
   the northern part of the study area, climate change led to a 10\%
   decline in the population and development led to an additional 7\%
   decline. At the project scale (8,331 km(2)), which was focused more
   narrowly on the landscape surrounding 4 proposed mines, the caribou
   population declined by 29\% largely in response to simulated
   development. Given that observed caribou population dynamics were
   sensitive to the cumulative effects of climate change, land use,
   interspecific interactions, and scale, insights from the analysis might
   not emerge under a less complex model. Our integrated modeling framework
   provides valuable support for broader regional assessments, including
   estimation of risk to caribou and Indigenous food security, and for
   developing and evaluating potential caribou recovery strategies. (c)

Abstract = {Diet is an important exposure route for phthalates, such as di-iso-butyl
   phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (DEHP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP). In this study, we aimed to
   estimate phthalate exposure in the diet of pregnant women and assess the
   health risk. A total of 517 pregnant women in the first trimester were
   recruited, and food frequency questionnaires were collected. A simple
   distribution assessment method was used to estimate daily exposure, and
   the hazard index (HI) method was used to assess cumulative risk. The
   maximum daily dietary exposure to DEHP, DBP, DiBP, and BBP was 5.25,
   3.17, 2.59, and 0.58 mu g/kg bw/day, respectively, and did not exceed
   the safety limit values. Cereals and vegetables were the main sources of
   the estimated daily intake (EDI) of phthalates in the diet. The
   cumulative risk assessment, based on the European Food Safety Authority
   tolerable daily intake (TDI) and the US Environmental Protection Agency
   reference dose (RfD), did not exceed the threshold of 1. DiBP, DBP, and
   DEHP had higher hazard quotient (HQ) values for cumulative health risk
   than BBP. In conclusion, a low health risk was posed by the cumulative
   dietary exposure to phthalates for pregnant women in Beijing.},

Title = {Legal pluralism and environmental governance: the regulatory design
   potential of Bhutan's gross national happiness and Canada's
   reconciliation approaches},
Journal = {LEGAL PLURALISM AND CRITICAL SOCIAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-95},
Abstract = {As humans exceed global ecological limits nation state-based
   environmental governance attracts persistent criticism. Historically,
   the focus of regulatory design for environmental law has been to provide
   access to natural resources or the environment but without
   ecosystem-based standards at any scale or cumulative effects assessment
   by which state governments evaluate whether they are achieving ecosystem
   health. Illuminated within these nation state regimes are two examples
   where legal pluralism has or is mandating environmental regulatory
   design that more explicitly elevates ecological function as a key
   outcome. Bhutan's relatively recent state environmental laws are part of
   its broader development approach of Gross National Happiness (GNH), an
   expression of state, Buddhist, and other customary laws. This `internal
   legal pluralism' in state policy is expressed through multiple layers of
   plans and project review by administrative agencies and a GNH screening
   tool. By contrast, Canada is reforming its environmental laws to account
   for cumulative impacts and Indigenous rights. In particular, state
   governments have committed to aligning their laws with the United
   Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and plural
   legal agreements establish unique collaborative governance bodies. The
   purpose of this article is to examine how legal pluralism is influencing
   the evolution of regulatory design for environmental governance in
   Bhutan and Canada. While the plural legal aspects of their regimes have
   resulted in the prioritization of ecological health, that focus in both
   regimes is vulnerable without further regulatory scaffolding to
   establish ecological limits that engage with multiple legal orders at
   various temporal and spatial scales.},

Title = {Constructing scale, eroding responsibility: The politics of project
   boundaries in Canadian pipeline reviews},
Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Decisions about whether to approve fossil fuel projects have major
   implications for climate change, biodiversity, and Indigenous rights. In
   Canada, cumulative effects tend to be only weakly assessed, with each
   project reviewed on its own terms. This paper investigates how fossil
   fuel companies strategically define project boundaries to facilitate
   resource extraction. Drawing on a preliminary scan of applications to
   Canadian federal review bodies from 2010 to 2022, complemented by
   detailed document analysis of three selected cases, we ask: in what ways
   have oil and gas proponents actively constructed scale through their
   project plans - with what consequences for regulatory scrutiny? Through
   careful reading of project applications, hearing documents, and company
   websites, we identify three strategies: (1) splitting work on the same
   infrastructure into multiple applications; (2) incrementally expanding a
   network; and (3) portraying interdependent facilities as stand-alone
   projects. These tactics are within the law, yet they narrow the scope of
   issues that regulators assess and make it more onerous for affected
   communities to participate in multiple reviews. Case studies of the Line
   9 pipeline, BC Pipeline network, and Gazoduq/' Energie Saguenay
   facilities show how regulators exempted smaller projects from more
   rigorous assessment, deemed cumulative effects assessment unnecessary,
   and excluded broader issues such as climate change and successive
   encroachment on Indigenous lands. Our findings contribute to work on the
   material consequences of relational scale, decolonial critiques of
   Canada's environmental governance regime, and efforts to advance climate
   justice by articulating how the legal geographies of energy projects
   shape responsibility for climate action.},

Title = {How does the cumulative impacts approach support Maritime Spatial
   Planning?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {189-202},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) needs to incorporate spatial information
   on human impacts. As human activities and uses increase in marine and
   coastal waters around the world, pressures in ecosystems are also
   increasing, leading to multiple adverse effects on different species and
   habitats. The European Directive on MSP aims to achieve an integrated
   approach to marine governance, whilst securing and maintaining the
   healthy status of marine and coastal waters, in accordance with the
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The latter requires Member States
   to develop assessments not only on pressures and impacts, but also on
   the state of the marine environment and then take measures towards
   reaching a Good Environmental Status by 2020.
   The Portuguese Maritime Spatial Plan - Plano de Ordenamento do Espaco
   Matitimo (POEM) was developed between 2009 and 2012. In 2014 a law
   establishing the Basis for the Spatial Planning and Management of the
   National Maritime Space was enacted and in 2015 the framework for the
   elaboration of a new national Maritime Spatial Plan, named Situation
   Plan, was established. Portugal will face, in the next five years, the
   challenge of planning and managing its marine space, whilst promoting
   its sustainable use and protection.
   This study adapted a cumulative effects assessment model to understand
   how the impacts from multiple threats affect the marine and coastal
   ecosystems and, how this information can be used to improve the
   management process. Information was gathered on intensity and
   distribution of activities and uses for the Portuguese continental
   subdivision marine area, quantified and mapped their cumulative impacts
   in marine ecosystems, and overlapped with the POEM. Results show that
   impacts are spreading from the coast up to the Contiguous Zone. Higher
   scores appear in Transitional and Coastal Waters in the north (Viana do
   Castelo/Figueira da Foz), centre (Peniche/Settibal) and south
   (Lagos/Faro). In some areas with higher ranks, statutes of nature
   conservation are already in place, but potential activities may still
   occur on top of existing ones. This study shows that the adapted model
   is a helpful tool to clarify ocean planning, identify areas of potential
   conflicts among users and support the decision making process. (C) 2016

Title = {Evidence-based evaluation of the cumulative effects of ecosystem
   restoration},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study adapts and applies the evidence-based approach for causal
   inference, a medical standard, to the restoration and sustainable
   management of large-scale aquatic ecosystems. Despite long-term
   investments in restoring aquatic ecosystems, it has proven difficult to
   adequately synthesize and evaluate program outcomes, and no standard
   method has been adopted. Complex linkages between restorative actions
   and ecosystem responses at a landscape scale make evaluations
   problematic and most programs focus on monitoring and analysis. Herein,
   we demonstrate a new transdisciplinary approach integrating techniques
   from evidence-based medicine, critical thinking, and cumulative effects
   assessment. Tiered hypotheses about the effects of landscape-scale
   restorative actions are identified using an ecosystem conceptual model.
   The systematic literature review, a health sciences standard since the
   1960s, becomes just one of seven lines of evidence assessed
   collectively, using critical thinking strategies, causal criteria, and
   cumulative effects categories. As a demonstration, we analyzed data from
   166 locations on the Columbia River and estuary representing 12
   indicators of habitat and fish response to floodplain restoration
   actions intended to benefit culturally and economically important,
   threatened and endangered salmon. Synthesis of the lines of evidence
   demonstrated that hydrologic reconnection promoted macrodetritis export,
   prey availability, and juvenile fish access and feeding. Upon
   evaluation, the evidence was sufficient to infer cross-boundary,
   indirect, compounding, and delayed cumulative effects, and suggestive of
   nonlinear, landscape-scale, and spatial density effects. Therefore, on
   the basis of causal inferences regarding food-web functions, we
   concluded that the restoration program is having a cumulative beneficial
   effect on juvenile salmon. The lines of evidence developed are
   transferable to other ecosystems: modeling of cumulative net ecosystem
   improvement, physical modeling of ecosystem controlling factors,
   meta-analysis of restoration action effectiveness, analysis of data on
   target species, research on critical ecological uncertainties,
   evidence-based review of the literature, and change analysis on the
   landscape setting. As with medicine, the science of ecological
   restoration needs scientific approaches to management decisions,
   particularly because the consequences affect species extinctions and the
   availability of ecosystem services. This evidence-based approach will
   enable restoration in complex coastal, riverine, and tidal-fluvial
   ecosystems like the lower Columbia River to be evaluated when data have
   accumulated without sufficient synthesis.},

Title = {The art of underperforming SEA - Symptomatic narratives from Germany},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {78},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {SEA spread around the world as has SEA effectiveness research.
   International SEA evaluations show mixed findings on SEA effectiveness.
   In this article, the quality and procedural effectiveness of SEA in
   Germany is analysed pursuing the hypothesis that SEA is influenced by
   planning and administrative traditions that tend to counteract to more
   ambitious SEA approaches. Three SEA case studies were analysed according
   to a set of criteria and indicators based on international research
   outcomes involving SEA integration into decision-making, scoping,
   selection and assessment of alternatives, cumulative effects assessment,
   tiering, public participation, and monitoring. The analysis draws on
   documents analysis and interviews with representatives from responsible
   agencies and involved SEA consultancies.
   The analysis shows that SEA is facilitating informed decision-making as
   the responsible agencies used the SEA, the interaction with
   consultancies, and the participation processes as a source of
   information. However, the case studies show various degrees of SEA
   quality in Germany based on the evaluated criteria and indicators.
   Results demonstrate that procedural effectiveness is limited. Unclear
   legal regulations, an expert-based planning approach instead of a
   collaborative approach, and organisational constraints limit the SEA
   quality. Furthermore, SEA performance is highly influenced by
   administrations' legalistic tradition, the expert-based planning
   culture, the home-grown planning system, and the bounded importance of
   SEA consultancies in the era of staff cuts and under-resourced agencies.
   Thus, the recommendations aim to strengthen a more collaborative
   planning approach, to build SEA capacity within SEA responsible
   agencies, and to clarify SEA regulations.
   The overall question for SEA evaluation research and practice may be how
   more collaborative planning approaches can effectively be implemented in
   planning and SEA practice through institutional learning.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {637},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Phthalates are predominantly used as plasticizers in daily consumer
   products. People are regularly exposed to phthalates through contact
   with these products. Phthalates are suspected to cause adverse effects
   in general population. We detected 10 metabolites of 6 phthalates in
   3348 urine samples of general population (infants (0-1 yr), children and
   adolescents (2-19 yr), adults (>= 20 yr), and pregnant women) from
   Shanghai. The Daily intake for phthalates was estimated based on the
   levels of urinary metabolites. Hazard quotient (HQ) was used to evaluate
   the risk from the exposure to a single chemical. For the cumulative risk
   calculation, HQs of different phthalates were added to produce the
   Hazard index (HI). Overall, exposure was low in adults but presented at
   a relatively high level throughout childhood. The exposure to some
   specific phthalates was high in infants and pregnant women. The
   cumulative risk assessment showed cause for concern mainly for infants
   and children subgroups. The results indicated that general population
   from Shanghai was widely exposed to phthalates and the infants were
   possibly at a high risk of cumulative exposure to phthalates. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Many studies have tried to explain spatial and temporal variations in
   biodiversity status of marine areas from a single-issue perspective,
   such as fishing pressure or coastal pollution, yet most continental seas
   experience a wide range of human pressures. Cumulative impact
   assessments have been developed to capture the consequences of multiple
   stressors for biodiversity, but the ability of these assessments to
   accurately predict biodiversity status has never been tested or
   ground-truthed. This relationship has similarly been assumed for the
   Baltic Sea, especially in areas with impaired status, but has also never
   been documented. Here we provide a first tentative indication that
   cumulative human impacts relate to ecosystem condition, i.e.
   biodiversity status, in the Baltic Sea. Thus, cumulative impact
   assessments offer a promising tool for informed marine spatial planning,
   designation of marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management,
   and may prove useful for setting limits on allowable levels of human
   impact on ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Benthic macroinvertebrate communities in five rivers of the Coastal
   Hudson Bay Lowland},
Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {37},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As a precursor to developing a biomonitoring program for rivers of the
   Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland, this study characterized and compared the
   benthic macroinvertebrate communities and water chemistry in 5 remote,
   previously undescribed, rivers near Fort Severn, Ontario, Canada. The pH
   of river water ranged from 8.1 to 8.7, total phosphorus from 11 to 26 mu
   g L-1, dissolved organic carbon from 8 to 12 mg L-1, and chloride from
   56 to 153 mg L-1. A total of 57 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa were
   represented, and the 10 most numerically dominant were the Chironominae
   (26 \% of collected individuals), Orthocladiinae (16 \%), oligochaetous
   clitellata (9 \%), Hyalellidae (7 \%), Hydropsychidae (6 \%), Gammaridae
   (5 \%), Elmidae (5 \%), Sphaeriidae/Pisidiidae (4 \%), Nemata (3 \%),
   and Tanypodinae (3 \%). Rivers' positions in ordinations of chemical and
   biological datasets were similar, suggesting that water chemistry has a
   role in structuring riverine benthic communities in the study region.
   Correlations between water-chemistry or habitat predictors and
   site-scores in the ordination of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa counts
   suggested that biological community structure was most associated with
   river-water pH, nutrient concentrations (e.g., total phosphorus,
   nitrogenous compounds, dissolved organic carbon, calcium, and silicate),
   the relative abundance of submerged macrophytes, conductivity (i.e., the
   concentrations of chloride and various other dissolved ions), and
   several geomorphological variables (e.g., bank-full river width, current
   speed, and the size of the dominant inorganic particles in the pavement
   layer of the streambed). Interest in mineral extraction and other
   resource-based exploration in Ontario's Far North is increasing. This
   study represents a start on baseline characterization for ecological
   monitoring and cumulative effects assessment that should proceed along
   with northern development.},

Abstract = {In 2020 the New South Wales Liquor Act was amended to allow the

   to use an impartial and objective methodology while advocating reliance
   on intangible criteria and selective use of data in order to increase
   applicant chances of success against a rebuttable presumption against

Title = {SCAIRM: A spatial cumulative assessment of impact risk for management},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {157},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {This study introduces SCAIRM, a Spatially explicit Cumulative Impact
   Assessment method specifically developed for application to guide
   Ecosystem-Based Management. The method incorporates relevant human
   activities, their pressures and their impacts on ecosystem components.
   Cumulative assessment methods usually apply categorical
   semi-quantitative scores based on expert judgement in order to be
   comprehensive, or alternatively, only cover a small subset of
   interactions using more sophisticated quantitative information. The
   SCAIRM approach aims to capture `the best of both worlds': it builds on
   categorical risk-based approaches, but modified such that their outcome,
   i.e. Impact Risk from cumulative pressures, is conceptually identical to
   the outcome from the quantitative approaches. This allows harmonization
   of qualitative and quantitative approaches into a single method, that
   has the advantage that it is comprehensive and can be used in data-poor
   situations while allowing the use of available quantitative information
   in more data-rich situations. It results in an improved capacity to
   inform policy or provide operational-centric guidance required for the
   essentially sectoral management. The method was applied to the North Sea
   ecosystem as an illustrative example of the typical output of most
   Cumulative Impact Assessments: indicating the ecosystem components
   mostly under threat, and the main activities and their pressures
   responsible for it. To that end, SCAIRM provides an assessment outcome
   expressed in ecologically meaningful terms, i.e. potential change in
   state compared to an undisturbed situation, implying all receptors
   except the pelagic water column to be potentially ``endangered{''} (more
   than 50\% decrease) and requiring conservation efforts. A decision tree
   was developed to guide management towards an increased effectiveness
   showing that much of the Impact Risk (41\%) is caused by few well-known
   stressors (7\%) that are difficult to mitigate but a remaining 29\% of
   the Impact Risk from many often lesser-known stressors (59\%) where
   management is likely to perform better.},

Title = {Prenatal exposure to phthalates and neurocognitive development in
   children at two years of age},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Phthalates are a family of endocrine disruptors with short
   elimination half-lives in the human body. To date, few epidemiological
   studies have examined repeated measures of maternal urinary phthalates
   and the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple phthalates on
   children's neurocognitive development.
   Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between children's
   neurocognitive development at 2 years of age and prenatal phthalate
   exposure, as assessed by repeated measurements during pregnancy, and to
   further examine the effects of co-exposure to multiple phthalates using
   cumulative risk assessment.
   Method: Within a prenatal cohort in Wuhan, China, we measured five
   high-molecular-weight (HMW) phthalates and three low-molecular-weight
   (LMW) phthalate metabolites' concentrations in three urine samples
   collected in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester of pregnancy from each
   mother. We assessed neurocognitive development by Bayley Scales of
   Infant and Toddler Development (BSID) at 2 years of age (n = 476) to
   obtain the children's mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor
   development index (PDI).
   Results: Higher exposure levels to LMW phthalates compared to HMW
   phthalates were observed in our population. Ln-transformed averaged
   concentration of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), a metabolite of the LMW
   phthalate di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) during pregnancy, was associated
   with decreased PDI scores in all children (beta = -1.90, 95\% CI: -
   3.43, - 0.37). Similarly, the averaged sum concentration of Sigma
   dibutyl phthalate (Sigma DBP) was associated with decreased PDI scores
   in all children (beta = -1.89, 95\% CI: -3.63, - 0.15). A negative trend
   of association between exposure to HMW phthalates and PDI scores was
   observed in girls, while a positive association was found in boys. In
   cumulative risk assessment analyses, we consistently observed that the
   hazard quotient of DnBP (the parent compound of MnBP) was inversely
   associated with PDI scores in all children, whereas the hazard quotient
   of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), an HMW phthalate, was positively
   associated with PDI scores in boys only.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to use repeated measurement of
   maternal urinary phthalates in all three trimesters to assess prenatal
   exposure in relation to children's neurodevelopment. Our study suggested
   a negative association between prenatal exposure to MnBP and children's
   psychomotor development, and potentially sex-specific associations
   between HMW phthalates and neurocognitive development among boys and
   girls. These findings warrant further confirmation.},

Abstract = {In 1991, provisions for environmental impact assessment in New Zealand
   were changed significantly with the enactment of the Resource Management
   Act. Among other provisions, this act requires consideration of
   cumulative impacts in environmental assessment activities undertaken by
   planners in newly created regional authorities and district and city
   councils. The institutional context in which the act is being
   implemented offers both opportunities and constraints to cumulative
   impact assessment. A lack of methods for CIA is a recognized problem.
   However, methods that have been developed for environmental impact
   assessments can be modified to incorporate second-, third-, and
   fourth-order impacts as well as to identify the direction and magnitude
   of additive and synergistic impacts. Layered matrices and combined
   networks are examples of such methods. While they do not allow for
   scientific prediction, they do provide the practitioner with the ability
   to consider the cumulative impacts of decisions. This is crucial in New
   Zealand, where statutory requirements are ahead of established
   methodologies.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment of phthalates associated with birth outcomes

Abstract = {A prospective cohort study of a Chinese population of mother-neonate
   pairs (n = 3103) was conducted to investigate the relationship between
   the cumulative hazard index (HI) of combined diethyl phthalate (DEP),
   dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dibenzyl phthalate (BBzP) and di(2-ethylhexyl)
   phthalate (DEHP) exposure and birth outcomes. The estimated HI for
   phthalates was based on phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine
   collected between 5th and 14th gestational weeks. The median HI values
   according to the European Food Safety Authority tolerable daily intake
   (HITD1) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference dose (HIRfD)
   were 0.358 and 0.187, respectively. A total of 163\% and 1.9\% of the
   women exhibited HITD1 and HIRfD exceeding the value of one,
   respectively. In unadjusted models, the categories (low < P-25, median
   P-25-P-50, high > P-75) of Him were associated with decreased birth
   weight (beta= -26.34 g, p = 0.021) and head circumference (beta= -0.09
   cm, p = 0.029), whereas those for HIRfD were negatively associated with
   birth weight (beta = -31.74 g, p = 0.005), birth length (beta = -0.11
   cm, p = 0.032), head circumference (beta = -0.13 cm, p = 0.003) and
   chest circumference (beta = -0.10 cm, p = 0.021) in all neonates.
   Adjustment for potential confounders revealed that HIRm was inversely
   associated with head circumference (beta = -0.10 cm, p = 0.020).
   Stratification by gender indicated that Him was associated with
   decreased birth length (beta = -0.17 cm, p = 0.041) in infant boys and
   Him was associated with decreased birth weight (beta = -33.12 g, p =
   0.036) and head circumference (beta = -0.13 cm, p = 0.027) in girls.
   This is the first study on the cumulative risk assessment of phthalate
   exposures in pregnant Chinese women. We found that the HI values of
   multiple phthalate co-exposure were sex specifically related to birth
   outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Human health risk assessments continue to evolve and now focus on the

   comprehensive evaluation of the interaction between different stressors
   and their combined impact on human health. Future directions of CRA
   include greater emphasis on local-level community-based assessments;
   integrating environmental, occupational, community, and individual risk

Abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute of
   Environmental Health (NIEHS) held a workshop in 2012 to discuss
   principles and applications of cumulative risk assessment (CRA). The
   workshop organizers chose cardiovascular disease (CVD) as an example
   health outcome for which cumulative risk considerations could illuminate
   environmental and health management strategies. To guide discussions, we
   developed a series of conceptual models illustrating factors influencing
   CVD. The CVD conceptual model represents complex processes across
   varying space and time scales, different causal pathways, and multiple
   chemical and non-chemical stressors and factors. It includes causal
   influences of environmental exposures and lifestyle choices, in the
   context of genetics and medical factors. The representation of
   cumulative risk as a network of interrelated nodes and arrows helps
   define and organize the problem and available information, determine the
   scope and scale, and creates a platform for analysis. It provides an
   interface for discussing how different entities (e.g., environmental
   versus health-driven organizations) can work together on different parts
   of the problem, and facilitates relative risk ranking and management
   triage. Color coding is used to distinguish categories of stressors and
   possible oversight responsibility. This work informs guidelines for CRA
   planning and assessment of factor combinations affecting real-world
   risk.},

Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH(s)) are often formed when organic
   substances do not burn completely. This study evaluates the
   non-carcinogenic and cumulative risks associated with PAH(s) levels by
   testing blood and urine samples in kitchen workers and residents near
   restaurants in Shiraz, Iran. Metabolites of PAH in the urine samples as
   well as clinical parameters in the blood samples were measured. The
   non-carcinogenic and cumulative risk assessments from exposure of the
   study groups to PAH metabolites were also evaluated. The highest average
   concentrations of PAH metabolites were related to kitchen workers
   (2126.7 ng/g creatinine (ng/g cr)). The metabolites of 1-Hydroxypyrene
   (1-OHP) and 9-Phenanthrene (9-OHPhe) had the highest and lowest mean
   concentrations, respectively. A direct correlation was observed between
   the levels of PAH metabolites with malondialdehyde (MDA) and total
   antioxidation capacity (TAC) levels (p < 0.05). Hazard Index (HIi) was
   obtained less than one (HIi < 1), indicating low-risk negative health
   impacts on the target groups. Nevertheless, conducting more studies to
   determine the health status of these people is quite evident.},

Title = {Life Cycle Dynamics of a Key Marine Species Under Multiple Stressors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Identifying key indicator species, their life cycle dynamics and the
   multiple driving forces they are affected by is an important step in
   ecosystem-based management. Similarly important is understanding how
   environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories
   of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and
   service provision. We here present a statistical modeling framework to
   assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the
   copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our
   model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life
   stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic
   processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod
   dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify
   conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or
   magnified. Our novel modeling approach reliably captures the historical
   P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in
   spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to
   direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors,
   salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate
   that population responses to stressors are dampened through density
   effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when
   acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive
   dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected
   under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable
   increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in
   predation pressure by 50\% each could counteract the negative effect of
   a 25\% decrease in salinity by only 6\%. Ultimately, our simulations
   suggest that P. acuspes will most certainly decline under a potential
   freshening of the Baltic Sea and increasing temperatures, which is
   conditional on the extent of the assumed climate change. Also the
   planned nutrient reduction strategy and fishery management plan will not
   necessarily benefit the temporal development of P. acuspes. Moving
   forward, there is a growing opportunity for using population modeling in
   cumulative effects assessments. Our modeling framework can help here as
   simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor
   interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change.},

Title = {Groundtruthing cumulative impact assessments with biodiversity data:
   Testing indicators and methods for marine ecosystem condition
   assessments in South Africa},
Journal = {AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Accurate assessments of ecosystem condition are needed to inform
   management processes such as systematic conservation planning and
   protected area expansion, marine spatial planning and other effective
   area-based conservation measures. Yet measuring the condition of dynamic
   and often largely inaccessible marine ecosystems is extremely difficult
   and presents a global challenge. Broad-scale cumulative impact
   assessments have been used in South Africa as a proxy for marine
   ecosystem condition in national assessments and reporting because the
   data are more readily available, and knowledge exists on the impacts of
   various human activities (or pressures) on marine ecosystems. While
   useful for national reporting, assessments based on in situ ecological
   data are also needed at finer scales relevant to management. Applying
   the HELCOM BEAT approach, this study used in situ ecological data to
   identify potential methods and indicators that can be applied in South
   Africa to conduct integrated ecosystem assessments and to assess the
   suitability of current cumulative impact assessments as a proxy for
   condition. Aggregated fish indicators demonstrated greater sensitivity
   to varying human pressures compared with benthic community indicators,
   with responsiveness differing by location. Notably, site-level
   differences in empirical condition emerged that broad-scale cumulative
   assessments often missed. The study thus highlighted the varying
   suitability of cumulative impact scores as proxies for condition,
   indicating their reliability for fish communities. However, this is also
   dependent on the pressure types included, the biotic indicators used and
   the area of focus. Conservation decisions based solely on cumulative
   impact scores could misrepresent the actual condition of the
   environment, which makes it difficult to make management decisions,
   especially at finer scales. As such, conservation initiatives need to be
   regionally adapted to effectively address the unique pressures and
   conditions of each area and should be tailored to account for fine-scale
   variability, instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.},

Title = {Evaluation of marine spatial planning requires fit for purpose
   monitoring strategies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) has rapidly become the most widely used
   integrated, place-based management approach in the marine environment.
   Monitoring and evaluation of MSP is key to inform best practices,
   adaptive management and plan iteration. While standardised evaluation
   frameworks cannot be readily applied, accounting for evaluation
   essentials such as the definition of evaluation objectives, indicators
   and stakeholder engagement of stakeholders is a prerequisite for
   meaningful evaluation outcomes. By way of a literature review and eleven
   practical MSP case studies, we analysed present day trends in evaluation
   approaches and unravelled the adoption of evaluation essentials for
   three categories for monitoring and evaluation for plan making, plan
   outcomes, and policy implementation. We found that at a global scale the
   focus of MSP evaluation has shifted over the past decade from evaluating
   predominantly plan outcomes towards the evaluation of plan making.
   Independent of the scope of the evaluation, evaluation approaches varied
   greatly from formal and structured processes, building for instance on
   MSP goals and objectives, to informal processes based on stakeholder
   interviews. We noted a trend in the adoption of formalised approaches
   where MSP evaluations have increasingly become linked to MSP policy
   goals and objectives. However, the enhanced use of MSP objectives and
   indicators did not result in a more straightforward reporting of
   outcomes, e.g. such as the achievement of specific MSP objectives.
   Overall, we found weak linkages between defined MSP objectives,
   indicators and available monitoring data. While the apparent shift
   towards a focus on objectives is promising, we highlight the need of
   fit-for purpose monitoring data to enable effective evaluation of those
   objectives. Hence, effective MSP and adaptive management processes
   require customised and concurrent monitoring and evaluation strategies
   and procedures. We argue that evaluation processes would also benefit
   from a better understanding of the general environmental, socio-economic
   and socio-cultural effects of MSP. Therefore, to understand better
   environmental effects of MSP, we praise that forthcoming MSP processes
   need to deepen the understanding and considerations of cause-effect
   pathways between human activities and changes of ecosystem state through
   the adoption of targeted cumulative effects assessments.},

Title = {Introducing relative potency quotient approach associated with

Abstract = {Children can be exposed to organophosphate and carbamate mixtures, which
   pose additive health effects via soil exposure. However, only 23
   countries have soil standard values for organophosphate and carbamate
   pesticides, and most regulatory jurisdictions do not consider the
   cumulative exposure. This study derived proposed soil standards for
   organophosphates and carbamates by introducing the relative potency
   quotient approach (RPQ). The probabilistic cumulative risk assessment
   was also applied to evaluate current soil standards of pesticide
   mixtures. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have soil
   standards of 19 organophosphates and five carbamates. However, these
   standards cannot protect population health via chronic exposure in
   conservative and semi-conservative scenarios based on the probabilistic
   risk assessment because the U.S.EPA simplified the regulatory process
   for the cumulative exposure to pesticide mixtures and omitted the soil
   allocation factor, which should be set for aggregate exposure. The
   analysis of proposed soil standards developed by the RPQ approach
   indicates that some human behavior variables, such as soil intake rate
   and exposure duration, have stronger impacts on the proposed soil
   standards than human biometric variables like body weight. This study
   may be helpful to develop regulatory standards and a framework for
   pesticide mixtures having additive health effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Cumulative impact assessment for ecosystem -based marine spatial
   planning},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {734},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Claims for ocean space are growing while marine ecosystems suffer from
   centuries of insufficient care. Human pressures from runoff, atmospheric
   emissions, marine pollution, fishing, shipping, military operations and
   other activities wear on habitats and populations. Ecosystem-based
   marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a strategic
   instrument for handling conflicting spatial claims among competing
   sectors and the environment. The twofold objective of both boosting the
   blue economy and protecting the environment is challenging in practice
   and marine planners need decision support. Cumulative Impact Assessment
   (CIA) was originally developed to provide an overview of the human
   imprint on the world's ocean ecosystems. We have now added a scenario
   component to the CIA model and used it within Swedish ecosystem-based
   MSP. This has allowed us to project environmental impacts for different
   planning alternatives throughout the planning process, strengthening the
   integration of environmental considerations into strategic
   decision-making. Every MSP decision may entail a local shift of
   environmental impact, causing positive or negative consequences for
   ecosystem components. The results from Swedish MSP in the North Sea and
   Baltic Sea illustrate that MSP certainly has the potential to lower net
   cumulative environmental impact, both locally and across sea basins, as
   long as environmental values are rated high and prevailing pressures
   derive from activities that are part of MSP. By synthesizing innumerous
   data into comprehensible decision support that informs marine planners
   of the likely environmental consequences of different options, CIA
   enables ecosystem-based MSP in practice.},

Abstract = {Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) include the examination of risks
   posed by multiple stressors and include population-specific
   vulnerabilities and susceptibilities. In this case study, we assess
   potential hearing impairment hazard due to joint exposure from noise and
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in order to examine the strengths and
   limitations of using secondary data on exposure and health effects for a
   CRA. Block group-level noise categories were estimated using modeled
   street-level data. A quantile regression model of sociodemographic and
   personal predictors from the 1999-2000U.S. National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey VOC dataset was used along with block group-level
   sociodemographic and personal variables to estimate VOC exposures.
   Hazard indices (HIs) for potential hearing impairment due to joint noise
   and VOC exposures were calculated. County-averaged HIs for hearing
   impairment ranged from 0.8 (10th total VOCs percentile and 45-60dB) to
   1.7 (90th total VOCs percentile and 71-75dB). Limitations of the
   exposure and health effects data included issues combining heterogeneous
   data and a lack of established threshold levels for combined low-level
   exposures; yet, this case study illustrates that screening-level CRAs,
   including non-chemical stressors, can be accomplished with publicly

Title = {A roadmap towards quantitative cumulative impact assessments: Every step
   of the way},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {784},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Currently most Cumulative Impacts Assessments (CIAs) are risk-based
   approaches that assess the potential impact of human activities and
   their pressures on the ecosystem thereby compromising the achievement of
   policy objectives. While some of these CIAs apply actual data (usually
   spatial distributions) they often have to rely on categorical scores
   based on expert judgement if they actually assess impact which is often
   expressed as a relative measure that is difficult to interpret in
   absolute terms. Here we present a first step-wise approach to conduct a
   fully quantitative CIA based on the selection and subsequent application
   of the best information available. This approach systematically
   disentangles risk into its exposure and effect components that can be
   quantified using known ecological information, e.g. spatial distribution
   of pressures or species, pressure-state relationships and population
   dynamics models with appropriate parametrisation, resulting in
   well-defined assessment endpoints that are meaningful and can be easily
   communicated to the recipients of advice. This approach requires that
   underlying assumptions and methodological considerations are made
   explicit and translated into a measure of confidence. This transparency
   helps to identify the possible data-handling or methodological decisions
   and shows the resulting improvement through its confidence assessment of
   the applied information and hence the resulting accuracy of the CIA.
   To illustrate this approach, we applied it in a North Sea CIA focussing
   on two sectors, i.e. fisheries and offshore windfarms, and how they
   impact the ecosystem and its components, i.e. seabirds, seabed habitats
   and marine mammals through various pressures. The results provide a
   ``proof of concept{''} for this generic approach as well as rigorous
   definitions of several of the concepts often used as part of risk-based
   approaches, e.g. exposure, sensitivity, vulnerability, and how these can
   be estimated using actual data. As such this widens the scope for
   increasingly more quantitative CIAs using the best information
   available.

Abstract = {The offshore wind energy sector in the United Kingdom (UK) has grown
   rapidly since the first turbine generators were installed in 2000: by
   2016 there were over 1400 installed turbines with combined capacity of
   5.1 GW. The sector is considered by UK Government as essential to the
   development of a low carbon economy and to meeting binding targets on
   carbon reduction and renewable energy generation. The Crown Estate,
   responsible for licensing development on the sea bed around the UK, has
   held three rounds of licensing since 2000 for wind developments. Some of
   the projects in the first two rounds suffered long delays due to
   uncertainty of project level impacts, particularly cumulative impacts. A
   number of key stakeholders identified a need for cumulative impact
   assessment (CIA) methodology to be developed that was definitive and
   endorsed by regulators and industry to aid unblocking barriers to
   delivery. This paper explores the background to the development of the
   guidelines and how they were `co-created' with industry and regulators.
   We evaluate to what extent they have been used to shape and develop
   practice.},

Title = {Temporal Variability of Cumulative Risk Assessment on Phthalates in

Pages = {6585-6591},

Abstract = {The assessment of the combined effects of multiple phthalate exposures
   at low levels is a newly developed concept to avoid underestimating
   their actual cumulative health risk. A previous study included 3455
   Chinese pregnant women. Each woman provided up to three urine samples
   (in total 9529). This previous study characterized the concentrations of
   phthalate metabolites. In the present study, the data from 9529 samples
   was reanalyzed to examine the cumulative risk assessment (CRA) with two
   models: (1) the creatinine-based and (2) the volume-based. Hazard index
   (HI) values for three phthalates, dibutyl phthalate, butyl benzyl
   phthalate, and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, in the first, second, and
   third trimesters of pregnancy, were calculated, respectively. In
   creatinine-based model, 3.43\%, 14.63\%, and 17.28\% of women showed HI
   based on the European Food Safety Authority tolerable daily intake
   exceeding 1 in the first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy,
   respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient of HI was 0.49
   (9S\% confidence interval: 0.46-0.53). Spearman correlations between HI
   of the creatinine model and and Sigma androgen disruptor (a developed
   potency weighted approach) ranged from 0.824 to 0.984. In summary, this
   study suggested a considerable risk of cumulative exposure to phthalates
   during the whole gestation in Chinese pregnant women. In addition,
   moderate temporal reproducibility indicated that single HI, estimated by
   the phthalate concentration in single spot of urine, seemed
   representative to describe the throughout pregnancy CRA. Finally, strong
   correlation between HI of the creatinine model and Sigma androgen
   disruptor revealed that the creatinine-based model was more appropriate
   to evaluate the CRA.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment of dietary exposure to triazole fungicides
   from 13 daily-consumed foods in China{*}},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {286},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The agroeconomic benefits of the routine use of triazole fungicides on
   crops have been evident for more than 40 years. However, increasing
   evidence shows that residues of triazoles are ubiquitous in various
   foods and thus could pose a potential health risk to humans. We analyzed
   3406 samples of 13 food commodities that were collected from markets in
   9 regions across China, and assessed the health risk of both chronic and
   acute exposure to the triazoles for Chinese children (1-6 years old) and
   the general population. Among all samples, 55.52\% had triazoles in
   concentrations of 0.10-803.30 mu g/kg, and 29.77\% of samples contained
   a combination of 2-7 tri-azoles. Tebuconazole and difenoconazole were
   the most commonly found triazoles in the foods, being detected in
   33.44\% and 30.45\% of samples, respectively. Chronic and acute
   cumulative risk assessment for total triazoles based on a relative
   potency factor method revealed that exposure to triazoles from these
   particular commodities was below the levels that might pose a health
   risk (chronic hazard index range, 5.90x10-7 to 1.83x10- 3; acute hazard
   index range, 7.77x10- 5 to 0.39, below 1). Notably, dietary exposure
   risk for children was greater than that for the general
   population-particularly for the acute intake of mandarin, grape, and
   cucumber (acute hazard index values of 0.35-0.39). Despite the low
   health risk, the potential hazards of exposure to triazoles should raise
   public concern owing to their ubiquitous presence in common foods and
   potential cumulative effects.

Title = {Fuzzy cognitive mapping as a tool to assess the relative cumulative
   effects of environmental stressors on an Arctic seabird population to
   identify conservation action and research priorities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. In the Arctic, chemical contaminants, shipping, oil pollution,
   plastic pollution, changing habitats in relation to climate change and
   fisheries have been identified as environmental stressors to seabirds
   such as Fulmarus glacialis (northern fulmar; qaqulluk;.(sic)), but
   rarely have these stressors been considered within a cumulative effects
   framework in this species which is currently showing a declining
   populations trend.
   2. As a novel tool to understand cumulative effects within a
   conservation context, we applied a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM)
   approach that allows experts to arrange key factors and their
   interrelationships, organizing their understanding of the components of
   a complex issue into a graphical representation; a `cognitive map'.
   3. This process was grounded in local environment concerns as documented
   in several Nunavut-specific reports and discussions, and worked with
   western-trained seabird experts with knowledge of northern fulmar
   populations to assess the inter-related environmental threats to fulmars
   as a way to combine these stressors in a cumulative effects framework
   and identify conservation actions and knowledge gaps.
   4. We found strong agreement that the main stressors affecting northern
   fulmar populations in Canada include pollution (11\% total influence
   (TI)), shipping activities (16\% TI), hunting and fishing (18\% TI) and
   mining/oil and gas exploitation activities (22\% TI).
   5. The indirect influence of threats on northern fulmar population size
   (57\% TI) exceeded the total direct influence (43\% TI), emphasizing the
   value of cognitive mapping in cumulative effects assessment for a more
   holistic understanding of interacting stressors.
   6. Participants expressed substantial uncertainty regarding the strong
   relationships leading from the concepts, commercial fishing activity in
   the BBDS and the North Atlantic fisheries activity, indicating that
   these potential stressors require more research.
   7. Similarly, uncertainty was expressed about the potential effects of
   zodiac traffic, ship strikes of northern fulmar, number of oil spills
   and magnitude of oil spills on northern fulmar.
   8. By characterizing individual factors as manageable or not, we
   determined that stressors are largely manageable with enforcement of
   existing policies (58\% TI)-importantly, fishing activities were both
   highly influential on fulmars and deemed manageable, which will inform
   ongoing co-management planning in the region.},

Title = {Twelve Recommendations for Advancing Marine Conservation in European and
   Contiguous Seas},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Like most ocean regions today, the European and contiguous seas
   experience cumulative impacts from local human activities and global
   pressures. They are largely in poor environmental condition with
   deteriorating trends. Despite several success stories, European policies
   for marine conservation fall short of being effective. Acknowledging the
   challenges for marine conservation, a 4-year multi-national network,
   MarCons, supported collaborative marine conservation efforts to bridge
   the gap between science, management and policy, aiming to contribute in
   reversing present negative trends. By consolidating a large network of
   more than 100 scientists from 26 countries, and conducting a series of
   workshops over 4 years (2016-2020), MarCons analyzed challenges,
   opportunities and obstacles for advancing marine conservation in the
   European and contiguous seas. Here, we synthesize the major issues that
   emerged from this analysis and make 12 key recommendations for policy
   makers, marine managers, and researchers. To increase the effectiveness
   of marine conservation planning, we recommend (1) designing coherent
   networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the framework of marine
   spatial planning (MSP) and applying systematic conservation planning
   principles, including re-evaluation of existing management zones, (2)
   designing MPA networks within a broader transboundary planning
   framework, and (3) implementing integrated land-freshwater-sea
   approaches. To address inadequate or poorly informed management, we
   recommend (4) developing and implementing adaptive management plans in
   all sites of the Natura 2000 European conservation network and revising
   the Natura 2000 framework, (5) embedding and implementing cumulative
   effects assessments into a risk management process and making them
   operational, and (6) promoting actions to reach `good environmental
   status' in all European waters. To account for global change in
   conservation planning and management, we further recommend (7)
   developing conservation strategies to address the impacts of global
   change, for example identifying climate-change refugia as high priority
   conservation areas, and (8) incorporating biological invasions in
   conservation plans and prioritizing management actions to control
   invasive species. Finally, to improve current practices that may
   compromise the effectiveness of conservation actions, we recommend (9)
   reinforcing the collection of high-quality open-access data, (10)
   improving mechanisms for public participation in MPA planning and
   management, (11) prioritizing conservation goals in full collaboration
   with stakeholders, and (12) addressing gender inequality in marine
   sciences and conservation.},

Title = {SEANERGY - a spatial tool to facilitate the increase of synergies and to
   minimise conflicts between human uses at sea},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {132},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With expanding human uses at sea, the objective of maritime spatial
   planning (MSP) to promote sustainable coexistence between marine uses
   becomes an increasingly challenging task. In order to assess coexistence
   options, both use-use interactions and use-environment interactions are
   important to explore. Tools for doing cumulative impact assessments
   (CIA) on the environment provide a means for spatially exploring
   environmental impacts. Finding inspiration in such ecosystem-based
   spatial use-environment approaches while drawing on pairwise marine use
   compatibility knowledge from existing literature, a spatial approach to
   model potential synergies and conflicts between marine uses through an
   expert-based scoring system is presented and implemented in SEANERGY, an
   ArcMap-based opensource toolbox. A test based on Baltic Sea GIS-data
   demonstrates how SEANERGY supplements CIA analyses with knowledge about
   potential use-use synergies, potential use-use conflicts, and their
   spatial extents, useful for optimising the use of marine space in MSP
   without putting too much cumulative pressure on the environment.},

Title = {A risk-based method to prioritize cumulative impacts assessment on
   marine biodiversity and research policy for offshore wind farms in
   France},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {264-276},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study developed the ``ECUME{''} risk-based approach to identify and
   prioritize critical impact pathways to be considered in cumulative
   impact assessment of offshore windfarms, and for future research. The
   prioritization framework has been tested on two offshore windfarms
   projects located in the French part of the English Channel off the coast
   of Normandy, those of Fe ` camp and Courseulles-sur-Mer. The approach is
   based on a complete inventory of impact pathways, prioritizing those for
   which an impact assessment will be carried out. The aim was to avoid a
   ``quantification bias{''} and elaborate a systemic vision. The novelty
   of the study is to apply a combination of expert judgement, consensus
   building, and a scoring system, to prioritize the pairs of pressures and
   receptors of the marine environment to work on. The scoring system is
   based on the ecological importance of receptors, the degree of knowledge
   on the effect of a pressure on a receptor and the sensitivity of each
   receptor to pressures. Priorities for research were also determined
   during the same process. Bringing together a large set of specialized
   marine environnement scientists, the initial challenge was to build a
   common vocabulary, and a shared understanding of the risk-based
   prioritization approach. This required significant time and effort but
   secured foundations for further work. This study confirms the
   increasingly shared view that adopting a risk-based approach considering
   adverse effects on receptors is an efficient way to assess cumulative
   impacts, to focus on critical impact pathways, and manage the scientific
   complexity and the significant uncertainties.},

Title = {A Case Study Application of the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and
   Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) Frameworks to Facilitate the Integration
   of Human Health and Ecological End Points for Cumulative Risk Assessment
   (CRA)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {52},

Pages = {839-849},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) methods promote the use of a conceptual
   site: model (CSM) to apportion exposures and integrate risk from
   multiple stressors. While CSMs may,encompass multiple species,
   evaluating end points across taxa can be challenging due to data
   availability and physiological differences among organisms. Adverse
   outcome pathways (AOPs) describe biological mechanisms leading to
   adverse outcomes (AOs) by assembling causal pathways with measurable
   intermediate steps termed key events (KEs), thereby providing a
   framework for integrating data across species. In this work, we used a
   case study focused on the perchlorate anion (ClO4-) to highlight the
   value of the AOP framework for cross-species data integration.
   Computational models and dose response data were used to evaluate the
   effects of ClO4- in 12 species and revealed a concordance across KEs and
   taxa. The aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) tracks stressors from sources
   to the exposures and serves as a complement to the AOP. We discuss how
   the combined AEP-AOP construct helps to maximize the use of existing
   data and advances CRA by (1) organizing toxicity and exposure data, (2)
   providing a mechanistic framework of KEs for integrating data across
   human health and ecological end points, (3) facilitating cross-species
   dose response evaluation, and (4) highlighting data gaps and technical
   limitations.},

Abstract = {Serious human health concerns have been recently raised from daily use
   of face masks, due to the possible presence of hazardous compounds as
   the phthalic acid esters (PAEs). In this study, the content of 11 PAEs
   in 35 commercial masks was assessed by applying a specific and accurate
   method, using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry. Surgical, FFP2 and
   non-surgical models, for both adults and children were collected from
   the Italian market. Analyses showed that four of the target analytes
   were detected in all tested samples with median total concentrations
   ranging between 23.6 mg/kg and 54.3 mg/kg. Results obtained from the
   experimental analysis were used in the risk assessment studies carried
   out for both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects. Doses of
   exposure (Dexp) of PAEs ranged from 6.43 x 10-5 mg/kg bw/day to 1.43 x
   10-2 mg/kg bw/day. Cumulative risk assessment was performed for
   non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects. No potential risk was found
   for non-carcinogenic effects, yet the 20\% of the mask samples showed
   potential carcinogenic effects for humans. A refined exposure assessment
   was performed showing no risk for carcinogenic effects. This paper
   presents a risk assessment approach for the identification of potential
   risks associated to the use of face masks.},

Title = {Urinary Excretion of Phthalate Metabolites in School Children of China:
   Implication for Cumulative Risk Assessment of Phthalate Exposure},

Abstract = {We analyzed 13 metabolites of 9 phthalates in urine of 782 Chinese
   school children aged 8-11 years and estimated the daily intake for
   phthalates based on urinary metabolite levels. The daily intakes were
   compared with acceptable intake levels to calculate the hazard quotient
   (HQ) for single phthalate. Finally, the cumulative risk for each child
   was assessed by means of a hazard index (HI) which is the sum of HQs.
   Overall, 11 metabolites were found in at least 85\% of the urine samples
   with the highest median concentration of 47.1 ng/mL (93.4 mu g/g
   creatinine) for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP). Monooctyl phthalate (MOP)
   and monoisononyl phthalate (MiNP) were not detectable. The cumulative
   risk assessment covering di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl
   phthalate (DnBP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), and butyl-benzyl
   phthalate (BBzP) demonstrated that 19.8\% (volume model-based) and
   40.3\% (creatinine model-based) of the children exceeded 1 for the HI
   based on tolerable daily intake (TDI) values (considered as potential
   adverse antiandrogenic effect). Furthermore, at least 36\% of the
   children from the manufacturing-intensive region had a HI higher than 1.
   The results indicate that Chinese children are widely exposed to
   phthalates and those from manufacturing-intensive regions are probably
   at a high risk of cumulative phthalate exposure.},

Abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia, covers over
   348,000 km(2) of tropical marine ecosystems of global significance. In
   July 2015, the World Heritage Committee called attention to the
   cumulative impacts of climate change, poor water quality, and coastal
   development on the region's outstanding universal value, but stopped
   short of inscribing the Great Barrier Reef on the List of World Heritage
   in Danger. Restoring the region's values is hindered by an environmental
   decision-making process that fails to incorporate cumulative impacts,
   including the climate change impacts of greenhouse gas emissions sourced
   from one of Australia's largest exports, thermal coal. We identify
   policy and processes that enable a more comprehensive consideration of
   the cumulative effects of coal mining by environmental decision-makers.
   Implementing cumulative impact assessment requires a collaborative and
   transparent program of planning and monitoring independent of Government
   and mine proponents that evaluates local, regional, and global impacts.
   The future of the Great Barrier Reef depends on transformational change
   in the cumulative assessment of Australian coal mines.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of multiple stressors on seagrasses in the context of
   marine spatial cumulative impacts assessment},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Humans are placing more strain on the world's oceans than ever before.
   Furthermore, marine ecosystems are seldom subjected to single stressors,
   rather they are frequently exposed to multiple, concurrent stressors.
   When the combined effect of these stressors is calculated and mapped
   through cumulative impact assessments, it is often assumed that the
   effects are additive. However, there is increasing evidence that
   different combinations of stressors can have non-additive impacts,
   potentially leading to synergistic and unpredictable impacts on
   ecosystems. Accurately predicting how stressors interact is important in
   conservation, as removal of certain stressors could provide a greater
   benefit, or be more detrimental than would be predicted by an additive
   model. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of
   additive, synergistic, and antagonistic stressor interaction effects
   using seagrasses as case study ecosystems. We found that additive
   interactions were the most commonly reported in seagrass studies.
   Synergistic and antagonistic interactions were also common, but there
   was no clear way of predicting where these non-additive interactions
   occurred. More studies which synthesise the results of stressor
   interactions are needed to be able to generalise interactions across
   ecosystem types, which can then be used to improve models for assessing
   cumulative impacts.},

Title = {Chemical-by-chemical and cumulative risk assessment of residential
   indoor exposure to semivolatile organic compounds in France},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The toxic effects of environmental exposure to chemicals are
   increasingly being studied and confirmed, notably for semivolatile
   organic compounds (SVOCs). These are found in many products and housing
   materials, from which they are emitted to indoor air, settled dust and
   other surfaces. Objectives: The objective of this work is to assess the
   human health risk posed by residential indoor exposure to 32 SVOCs,
   assessed in previous nationwide studies.
   Methods: A chemical-by-chemical risk assessment, using a hazard quotient
   (HQ) or excess risk (ER) method, was supplemented by a cumulative risk
   assessment (CRA). For CRA, a hazard index (HI) method, as well as higher
   tier approaches using relative potency factors (RPFs) or toxic
   equivalency factors (TEFs) were used for the following endpoints:
   neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity.
   Results: HQs were above 1 for 50\% of French children from birth to 2
   years for BDE 47, and for 5\% of children for lindane and dibutyl
   phthalate (DBP). Corresponding hazards are reprotoxic for BDE 47 and
   DBP, and immunotoxic for lindane. The CRA approach provided additional
   information of reprotoxic risks (HI > 1) that may occur for 95\% of
   children and for 5\% of the offspring for pregnant women's exposure. The
   SVOCs contributing most to these risks were PCB 101 and 118, BDE 47, and
   DBP. The higher tier CRA approaches showed that exposure to dwellings'
   SVOC mixtures were of concern for 95\% of children for neurotoxic
   compounds having effects linked with neuronal death. To a lesser extent,
   effects mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) or by a decrease
   in testosterone levels may concern 5\% of children and adults. Lastly,
   unacceptable immunotoxic risk related to exposure to 8 indoor PCBs was
   also observed for 5\% of children.
   Conclusions: In view of uncertainties related to compounds' toxicity for
   humans, these results justify the implementation of preventive measures,
   as well as the production of more standardized and comprehensive
   toxicological data for some compounds.},

   well as clinical parameters in the blood samples were measured. The
   non-carcinogenic and cumulative risk assessments from exposure of the
   study groups to PAH metabolites were also evaluated. The highest average
   concentrations of PAH metabolites were related to kitchen workers
   (2126.7 ng/g creatinine (ng/g cr)). The metabolites of 1-Hydroxypyrene
   (1-OHP) and 9-Phenanthrene (9-OHPhe) had the highest and lowest mean
   concentrations, respectively. A direct correlation was observed between
   the levels of PAH metabolites with malondialdehyde (MDA) and total
   antioxidation capacity (TAC) levels (p < 0.05). Hazard Index (HIi) was
   obtained less than one (HIi < 1), indicating low-risk negative health
   impacts on the target groups. Nevertheless, conducting more studies to
   determine the health status of these people is quite evident.},

Title = {Spatial distribution of cumulative impact on terrestrial ecosystem of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Antarctica, an area that is devoted to global peace and research, is
   being challenged by climate change, human activities, and pollution.
   There have been a number of studies concerning the state of the
   Antarctic ecological environment. However, a comprehensive and
   quantitative assessment of the impact of threats on the Antarctica
   ecological environment is still lacking. In this study, a cumulative
   impact assessment performed on the basis of expert judgement was used to
   estimate species-specific differences on the impact of seven threats:
   climate change, organic and nonorganic pollutants, station construction,
   power generation, oil spilling, and tourism. The terrestrial area of the
   Fildes Peninsula was divided into 103 cells using a raster grid of 0.25
   km(2), and cumulative impact assessment was applied to each cell. The
   analysis results indicated that cumulative impact scores (I-C) ranged
   from 0 to 39.4, and the cumulative scores were divided into six
   categories ranging from very low impact (I-C <= 7.08) to very high
   impact (I-C > 20.54). More than half of the terrestrial area (57.3\%)
   experienced ``Very Low Impact{''} or ``Low impact{''} scores. For single
   factors, climate change was identified as a rapidly growing and
   significant threat facing the terrestrial ecosystems of Antarctica. In
   addition, tourism had the greatest impact among all human activities.
   The analytical process and resulting map indicate that it is necessary
   to develop international policies on the restriction of tourist activity
   space and strength the organic pollutant controls for terrestrial
   ecosystem protection in the Fildes Peninsula, Antarctica.},

Title = {Including past and present impacts in cumulative impact assessments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {20},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Environmental concerns such as loss of biological diversity and
   stratospheric ozone depletion have heightened awareness of the need to
   assess cumulative impacts in environmental documents. More than 20 years
   of experience with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) have
   provided analysts in the United States with opportunities for developing
   successful techniques to assess site-specific impacts of proposed
   actions. Methods for analyzing a proposed action's incremental
   contribution to cumulative impacts are generally less advanced than
   those for project-specific impacts.
   The President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) defines
   cumulative impact to include the impacts of `'past, present and
   reasonably foreseeable future actions'' regardless of who undertakes the
   action. Court decisions have helped clarify the distinction between
   reasonably foreseeable future actions and other possible future actions.
   This paper seeks to clarify how past acid present impacts should be
   included in cumulative impact analyses.
   The definition of cumulative impacts implies that cumulative impact
   analyses should include the effects of all past and present actions on a
   particular resource. Including past and present impacts in cumulative
   impact assessments increases the likelihood of identifying significant
   impacts. NEPA requires agencies to give more consideration to
   alternatives and mitigation and to provide more opportunities for public
   involvement for actions that would have significant impacts than for
   actions that would not cause or contribute to significant impacts. For
   an action that would contribute to significant cumulative impacts, the
   additional cost and effort involved in increased consideration of
   alternatives and mitigation and in additional public involvement may be
   avoided if the action can be modified so that its contributions to
   significant cumulative impacts are eliminated.},

Abstract = {Wind farms have a negative impact on several animal populations, with
   birds and bats assumed to be among the most heavily affected taxa. In
   addition to the extensive development of wind power on land, currently
   several European countries have offshore wind farms (OWFs) in operation,
   as well as proposals to build many more. Considering that seabirds spend
   more than 90\% of their life at sea, it is clear that they may interact
   with these man-made structures. To date, information on how to measure
   the impact of OWFs on seabirds is very scarce. In many cases it comes
   from non-peer reviewed reports made for specific assessment studies,
   very often carried out without appropriate standard methodologies, that
   raise questions regarding the level of confidence that they merit. In
   this paper, we describe the current political framework concerning the
   possible development of OWFs in Spain. Based on this, we comment on both
   the relevant variables necessary to assess the impacts of OWFs on birds
   and the methodologies available to collect those variables in the field,
   discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method. We show the
   importance of collision risk models, vulnerability indexes, cumulative
   impact assessment and population viability analysis as management tools.
   Mitigation measures that have the potential to minimise impacts are also
   summarised. We conclude with a discussion of the different steps to
   follow to attain a `clean' development of offshore wind energy in Spain.},

Title = {Why cumulative impacts assessments of hydrocarbon activities in the
   Arctic fail to meet their purpose},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {725-737},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Arctic Region is characterised by vulnerable ecosystems and residing
   indigenous people, dependent on nature for subsistence fishing and
   hunting. The Arctic also contains a wealth of non-living natural
   resources such as minerals and hydrocarbons. Synergies between increased
   access and growing global demand for the Arctic resources influence the
   level and nature of human activity and its influence on the environment.
   It is therefore essential to assess and mitigate the cumulative impacts
   from these activities. Environmental Assessment (EA) is a common tool
   applied by the Arctic nations to secure that environmental
   considerations are included in decision-making when new plans and
   projects are implemented. However, recent research has indicated that
   assessment of cumulative impacts in EAs is inconsistent and the
   practises ambiguous. This article explores this phenomenon further by
   reviewing and analysing current practices of assessing cumulative
   impacts in EAs in relation to offshore oil and gas activities in the
   Arctic. It is found that cumulative impacts assessments are generally
   lacking. The practitioners involved explain this with reference to the
   challenge of addressing and assessing cumulative impacts due to their
   complex nature. They further point at lacking methodological guidelines
   as well as lack of resources during the impact assessment process.},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Frequent cases of soil and water contamination by perchlorates, and
   consequent toxicity to plants, animals and humans have drawn attention
   worldwide. Anthropogenic actions are the main cause for this pollution.
   Due to high levels of oxidation, perchlorates are commonly used to
   produce solid propellants for rockets and missiles, fireworks, and air
   bag inflators and also as bleach in paper industry. In this work we
   assessed the effects of ammonium and sodium perchlorates singly and in
   mixture to Daphnia magna by studying the endpoints: immobilization,
   reproduction, growth and feeding activities.
   At short time exposures characterized with immobilization and feeding
   parameters, ammonium perchlorate was 10 times more toxic to D. magna
   than sodium perchlorate. On the other hand, toxicity was similar when a
   long-term exposure with reproduction parameter was carried out. The
   mixture toxicity approach also showed that sodium perchlorate was ruled
   for synergistic patterns when dominant in the short-term exposure tests.
   When evaluating the reproductive effort by using the number of neonates,
   the concentration addition model was the best fit.
   This study shows that the different properties of two chemicals,
   highlighting the possible synergy that can occur when chemicals are
   present in mixtures, will be of high relevance to improve Cumulative
   Risks assessment procedures.},

Title = {Mixture Effects of Estrogenic Pesticides at the Human Estrogen Receptor
   α and β},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {Consumers of fruits and vegetables are frequently exposed to small
   amounts of hormonally active pesticides, some of them sharing a common
   mode of action such as the activation of the human estrogen receptor
   alpha (hER alpha) or beta (hER beta). Therefore, it is of particular
   importance to evaluate risks emanating from chemical mixtures, in which
   the individual pesticides are present at human-relevant concentrations,
   below their corresponding maximum residue levels. Binary and ternary
   iso-effective mixtures of estrogenic pesticides at effect concentrations
   eliciting a 1 or 10\% effect in the presence or absence of 17
   beta-estradiol were tested experimentally at the hER alpha in the
   yeast-based estrogen screen (YES) assay as well as in the human U2-OS
   cell-based ER alpha chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (ER
   alpha CALUX) assay and at the hER beta in the ER beta CALUX assay. The
   outcome was then compared to predictions calculated by means of
   concentration addition. In most cases, additive effects were observed
   with the tested combinations in all three test systems, an observation
   that supports the need to expand the risk assessment of pesticides and
   consider cumulative risk assessment. An additional testing of mixture
   effects at the hER beta showed that most test substances being active at
   the hER alpha could also elicit additive effects at the hER beta, but
   the hER beta was less sensitive. In conclusion, effects of the same
   ligands at the hER alpha and the hER beta could influence the estrogenic
   outcome under physiological conditions.},

Title = {Cumulative impact assessments and bird/wind farm interactions:
   Developing a conceptual framework},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The wind power industry has grown rapidly in the UK to meet EU targets
   of sourcing 20\% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Although wind
   power is a renewable energy source, there are environmental concerns
   over increasing numbers of wind farm proposals and associated cumulative
   impacts. Individually, a wind farm, or indeed any action, may have minor
   effects on the environment, but collectively these may be significant,
   potentially greater than the sum of the individual parts acting alone.
   EU and UK legislation requires a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as
   part of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). However, in the absence
   of detailed guidance and definitions, such assessments within EIA are
   rarely adequate, restricting the acquisition of basic knowledge about
   the cumulative impacts of wind farms on bird populations. Here we
   propose a conceptual framework to promote transparency in CIA through
   the explicit definition of impacts, actions and scales within an
   assessment. our framework requires improved legislative guidance on the
   actions to include in assessments, and advice on the appropriate
   baselines against which to assess impacts. Cumulative impacts are
   currently considered on restricted scales (spatial and temporal)
   relating to individual development EIAs. We propose that benefits would
   be gained from elevating CIA to a strategic level, as a component of
   spatially explicit planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Quantitative Source-to-Outcome Case Study To Demonstrate the
   Integration of Human Health and Ecological End Points Using the

Abstract = {Exposure to environmental contaminants can lead to adverse outcomes in
   both human and nonhuman receptors. The Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP)
   and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) frameworks can mechanistically inform
   cumulative risk assessment for human health and ecological end points by
   linking together environmental transport and transformation, external
   exposure, toxicokinetics, and toxicodynamics. This work presents a case
   study of a hypothetical contaminated site to demonstrate a quantitative
   approach for implementing the AEP framework and linking this framework
   to AOPs. We construct an AEP transport and transformation model and then
   quantify external exposure pathways for humans, fishes, and small
   herbivorous mammals at the hypothetical site. A Monte Carlo approach was
   used apportionment was quantified for each species, and published
   pharmacokinetic models were used to exposure from external exposures.
   Published dose response data for a multispecies AOP network were used to
   interpret AEP results in the context of species-specific effects. This
   work demonstrates (1) the construction, analysis, and application of a
   quantitative AEP model, (2) the utility of AEPs for organizing
   mechanistic exposure data and highlighting data gaps, and (3) the
   advantages provided by a source-to-outcome construct for leveraging
   exposure data and to aid transparency regarding assumptions.},

Title = {Mineral extraction in Swedish Sapmi: The regulatory gap between Sami
   rights and Sweden's mining permitting practices},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {99},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In Sweden, extractive industries are placing increasing pressure on the
   traditional indigenous Sami livelihood of reindeer herding.
   Consequently, the intersection of indigenous rights and mining-related
   development in Sweden has become an increasingly contested socio-legal
   space. In this article, we analyse the extent to which there are
   meaningful opportunities for Sami reindeer herding communities in Sweden
   to effectively influence the permit procedures concerning proposed
   mines, in order to protect their rights and interests. We provide a
   comprehensive socio-legal analysis that highlights the weak level of
   recognition of Sami rights and related impact assessments within the
   mining permitting system in Sweden. We demonstrate the weakness is
   caused by several factors: an a priori assumption by Swedish authorities
   that reindeer herding and mining can generally coexist; the lack of a
   codified Swedish State duty to consult the Sami; the narrow scope and
   the weak status of cumulative impact assessments in Swedish EIA
   legislation and practice; and the weak recognition of Sami reindeer
   herding as a ``property right{''} during the permit review process under
   the balancing of competing land uses. Our results highlight the urgent
   need for legislative reform in Sweden, if the State is to fulfil its
   international obligations and improve its legal consistency concerning
   the rights of the Sami as an indigenous people.},

Title = {Definition and Applications of a Versatile Chemical Pollution Footprint
   Methodology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {48},
Number = {18},
Pages = {10588-10597},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Because of the great variety in behavior and modes of action of
   chemicals, impact assessment of multiple substances is complex, as is
   the communication of its results. Given calls for cumulative impact
   assessments, we developed a methodology that is aimed at expressing the
   expected cumulative impacts of mixtures of chemicals on aquatic
   ecosystems for a region and subsequently allows to present these results
   as a chemical pollution footprint, in short: a chemical footprint.
   Setting and using a boundary for chemical pollution is part of the
   methodology. Two case studies were executed to test and illustrate the
   methodology. The first case illustrates that the production and use of
   organic substances in Europe, judged with the European water volume,
   stays within the currently set policy boundaries for chemical pollution.
   The second case shows that the use of pesticides in Northwestern Europe,
   judged with the regional water volume, has exceeded the set boundaries,
   while showing a declining trend over time. The impact of mixtures of
   substances in the environment could be expressed as a chemical
   footprint, and the relative contribution of substances to that footprint
   could be evaluated. These features are a novel type of information to
   support risk management, by helping prioritization of management among
   chemicals and environmental compartments.},

Title = {Using a relative health indicator (RHI) metric to estimate health risk
   reductions in drinking water},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {189},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {When a new drinking water regulation is being developed, the USEPA
   conducts a health risk reduction and cost analysis to, in part, estimate
   quantifiable and non-quantifiable cost and benefits of the various
   regulatory alternatives. Numerous methodologies are available for
   cumulative risk assessment ranging from primarily qualitative to
   primarily quantitative. This research developed a summary metric of
   relative cumulative health impacts resulting from drinking water, the
   relative health indicator (RHI). An intermediate level of quantification
   and modeling was chosen, one which retains the concept of an aggregated
   metric of public health impact and hence allows for comparisons to be
   made across ``cups of water,{''} but avoids the need for development and
   use of complex models that are beyond the existing state of the science.
   Using the USEPA Six-Year Review data and available national occurrence
   surveys of drinking water contaminants, the metric is used to test risk
   reduction as it pertains to the implementation of the arsenic and
   uranium maximum contaminant levels and quantify ``meaningful{''} risk
   reduction. Uranium represented the threshold risk reduction against
   which national non-compliance risk reduction was compared for arsenic,
   nitrate, and radium. Arsenic non-compliance is most significant and
   efforts focused on bringing those non-compliant utilities into
   compliance with the 10 mu g/L maximum contaminant level would meet the
   threshold for meaningful risk reduction.},

Title = {Endocrine disruptor phthalates in bottled water: daily exposure and
   health risk assessment in pregnant and lactating women},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {188},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, the consumption of water bottled in polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) has considerably increased, raising concerns over
   water quality and packaged materials. This study aims to investigate the
   levels of the anti-androgenic phthalates including bis-(2-ethylhexyl)
   phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and benzyl butyl phthalate
   (BBP), in bottled water and its corresponding health risks in pregnant
   and lactating women. The phthalate levels were measured in six different
   brands of bottled water exposed to temperatures ranging between -18 and
   40 degrees C and sunlight for 45 days. The phthalate was quantified
   using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the
   non-carcinogenic effects were assessed using hazard quotient (HQ)
   approach, and cumulative health risk assessment was performed on the
   basis of hazard index (HI) calculation. In order to assess the
   carcinogenic risk due to the possible carcinogen DEHP (group 2B), the
   excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) was used. DEHP and DBP contaminants
   were detected at different storage conditions in all of the bottled
   water samples during the storage time. BBP was only detected at high
   temperature (>= 25 degrees C) and outdoor conditions. The maximum
   concentrations of all phthalates were observed when water samples were
   kept at 40 degrees C. In contrast, storage at freezing conditions had no
   significant effect on the concentration level of all phthalates. The
   estimated intake by women was between 0.0021 mu g/kg/day for BBP and
   0.07 mu g/kg/day for DEHP. The highest HQ for phthalate intake via
   bottled water consumption was much lower than 1 (HQ < 0.004), which
   implies that adverse effects are very unlikely to occur. The execution
   of a cumulative risk assessment for combined phthalate exposure
   demonstrated that the HIs for anti-androgenic effect were lower than 1
   in all of the conditions. Furthermore, ELCR for DEHP based on the
   highest detected level was found to be less than 10-6, which is
   considered acceptable. Our results prove that the levels of phthalates
   in bottled water are not a health concern for pregnant and lactating
   women. Consequently, PET-bottled water is not a major contributor to
   phthalate intake for most individuals.},

Title = {Assessing marine ecosystem services richness and exposure to
   anthropogenic threats in small sea areas: A case study for the
   Lithuanian sea space},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Lithuanian sea space belongs to the smallest sea areas in Europe.
   The sea space incorporates multiple marine ecosystem services (MES) that
   support human-wellbeing and sustain maritime economies, but is also
   subjected to intensive anthropogenic activities that can affect its
   vulnerable ecological components. We present a flexible geospatial
   methodology to assess MES richness (MESR) and to analyse areas of
   exposure of MES to human impacts using a MES exposure index (MESEx).
   Source of anthropogenic threats to MES were firstly derived from the
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive and include marine litter (from
   ports and shipping), underwater noise (from offshore pile driving and
   shipping) and hazardous substances (from oil extraction platforms).
   Results were presented for the three main planning areas in Lithuania,
   the Lithuanian Coastal Stripe, territorial waters and EEZ. In detail,
   areas of highest MESR are located in the coastal areas of the Lithuanian
   Mainland Coast that are particularly rich in ecosystem services such as
   nursery function from for Baltic Herring and cultural services related
   to valuable recreational resorts, landscape aesthetic values and natural
   heritage sites. Modelled pressure exposure on selected MES show that
   cultural ecosystem services in proximity of Klaipeda Port can be
   particularly affected by marine litter accumulation phenomena, while
   transboundary effects of potential oil spills from D6-Platform
   (Kaliningrad Region) can affect valuable fish provisioning areas and
   coastal cultural values in the Curonian Spit. Results were discussed for
   the relevance in MES assessment for marine spatial planning in small sea
   areas and the methodological outlook of the application of geospatial
   techniques on cumulative impacts assessment within this region of the
   Baltic Sea.},

Title = {The relationship between the female athlete triad and injury rates in
   collegiate female athletes},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background: This study aimed to clarify the relationship between the
   triad risk assessment score and the sports injury rate in 116 female
   college athletes (average age, 19.8 +/- 1.3 years) in seven sports at
   the national level of competition; 67 were teenagers, and 49 were in
   their 20s.
   Methods: Those with menstrual deficiency for >3 months or <6 menses in
   12 months were classified as amenorrheic athletes. Low energy
   availability was defined as adolescent athletes having a body weight
   <85\% of ideal body weight, and for adult athletes in their 20s, a body
   mass index <= 17.5 kg/m(2). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured on
   the heel of the right leg using an ultrasonic bone densitometer. Low BMD
   was defined as a BMD Z-score <-1.0. The total score for each athlete was
   calculated. The cumulative risk assessment was defined as follows: low
   risk (a total score of 0-1), moderate risk (2-5), and high risk (6). The
   injury survey recorded injuries referring to the injury survey items
   used by the International Olympic Committee.
   Results: In swimming, significantly more athletes were in the low-risk
   category than in the moderate and high-risk categories (p = 0.004). In
   long-distance athletics, significantly more athletes were in the
   moderate-risk category than in the low and high-risk categories (p =
   0.004). In the moderate and high-risk categories, significantly more
   athletes were in the injury group, whereas significantly more athletes
   in the low-risk category were in the non-injury group (p = 0.01).
   Significantly more athletes at moderate and high-risk categories had
   bone stress fractures and bursitis than athletes at low risk (p =
   0.023).
   Discussion: These results suggest that athletes with relative energy
   deficiency may have an increased injury risk.},

Title = {A data-limited method for assessing cumulative fishing risk on bycatch},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},
Number = {4},
Pages = {837-847},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {To assess fishing effects on data-poor species, impact can be derived
   from spatial overlap between species distribution and fishing effort and
   gear catchability. Here, we enhance the existing sustainability
   assessment for fishing effect method by estimating gear efficiency and
   heterogeneous density from sporadic catch data. We apply the method to
   two chondrichthyan bycatch species, Bight Skate and Draughtboard Shark
   in Australia, to assess cumulative fishing mortality (F-cum) from
   multiple fisheries. Gear efficiency is estimated from a Bayesian mixture
   distribution model and fish density is predicted by a generalized
   additive model. These results, combined with actual fishing effort,
   allow estimation of fishing mortality in each sector and subsequently,
   the F-cum. Risk is quantified by comparing F-cum with reference points
   based on life history parameters. When only the point estimates were
   considered, our result indicates that for the period 2009 and 2010 Bight
   Skate caught in 14 fisheries was at high cumulative risk (F-cum >=
   F-lim) while Draughtboard Shark caught by 19 fisheries was at low
   cumulative risk (F-cum <= F-msy). Because of the high cost of conducting
   cumulative risk assessments, we recommend examining the distribution of
   fishing effort across fisheries before carrying out the assessments.},

Abstract = {This research surveyed the concentrations of five organophosphorus
   pesticides (OPs) in vegetables with the purpose of assessing the
   potential integrated health risks of residents. From 2018 to 2020, 870
   samples of eight kinds of vegetables from Zhejiang Province were
   collected. Gas chromatography coupled with a flame photometric detector
   (GC-FPD) analyzed the five OPs. OPs were most frequently detected in
   celery (18.9\% of samples), cowpeas (18.3\% of samples), and leeks
   (16.9\% of samples) compared to other vegetables. Among the 11 cities in
   Zhejiang, the cities with high detection rates of OPs were Ningbo and
   Hangzhou. The integrated concentrations of OPs in different cities
   ranged from 71.9 to 376 mu g/kg. The cumulative risk assessment revealed
   that the estimated daily intake (EDI) of leek in Wenzhou was the
   highest, which was 0.0077 (mg/kg bw) and 0.0059 (mg/kg bw) in adults and
   children respectively. The health risks of residents who consume these
   vegetables were within a safe range. The data provided demonstrate the
   distribution and potential health hazards of OPs in commonly consumed
   vegetables.},

Title = {Neonicotinoid insecticides in surface water from the central Yangtze
   River, China},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {229},
Pages = {452-460},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) are extensively used insecticides
   worldwide, yet the data on NNIs residues in the Yangtze River, China is
   scarce. Occurrence and distribution of six NNIs and a metabolite
   (desmethyl-acetamiprid) in surface water were investigated in the
   central Yangtze River, China at 20 sites from March to July and
   September 2015. Acetamiprid (ACE), imidacloprid (IMI) and thiamethoxam
   (THM) were the most frequently detected NNIs and IMI had a highest
   median concentration of 4.37 ng/L, followed by ACE (2.50 ng/L), THM
   (1.10 ng/L), nitenpyram (NTP; 0.34 ng/L), clothianidin (CLO; 0.10 ng/L),
   and thiacloprid (THCP; 0.02 ng/L). Significantly higher concentrations
   and detection frequencies of NNIs were observed in the summer than in
   the spring, which may be explained by the heavier precipitation in
   summer. Spatial variation with higher levels among the lower sites than
   the upper sites may be related with the agriculture land use. NNI
   contamination presented a low risk to aquatic life according to the risk
   quotient method, while IMI had potential risk to aquatic life according
   to the threshold of IMI (8.3 ng/L) in freshwater recommended in
   Netherland. Using the relative potency factors method for chronic
   cumulative risk assessment for NNIs, potential exposure to NNIs through
   water ingestion are three orders of magnitude lower than the recommended
   relative chronic reference dose. Ongoing environmental monitoring of
   NNIs is needed due to the increase use of NNIs in China. (C) 2019

Title = {Cumulative Risk Evaluation of Phthalates Under TSCA},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Number = {16},
Pages = {6403-6414},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently conducting
   separate Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluations for seven
   phthalates: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP),
   di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP),
   dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and
   diisononyl phthalate (DINP). Phthalates are highly abundant plastic
   additives used primarily to soften materials and make them flexible, and
   biomonitoring shows widespread human exposure to a mixture of
   phthalates. Evidence supports biological additivity of phthalate mixture
   exposures, including the enhancement of toxicity affecting common
   biological targets. Risk estimates based on individual phthalate
   exposure may not be protective of public health. Thus, a cumulative risk
   approach is warranted. While EPA initially did not signal that it would
   incorporate cumulative risk assessment (CRA) as part of its current risk
   evaluation for the seven phthalates, the agency recently announced that
   it is reconsidering if CRA for phthalates would be appropriate. Based on
   our review of existing chemical mixtures risk assessment guidance,
   current TSCA scoping documents for the seven phthalates, and pertinent
   peer-reviewed literature, we delineate a CRA approach that EPA can
   easily implement for phthalates. The strategy for using CRA to inform
   TSCA risk evaluation for existing chemicals is based upon integrative
   physiology and a common adverse health outcome algorithm for identifying
   and grouping relevant nonchemical and chemical stressors. We recommend
   adjustments for how hazard indices (HIs) or margins of exposure (MOEs)
   based on CRA are interpreted for determining ``unreasonable risk{''}
   under TSCA.},

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {203},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {We report on EU Member States' assessment of the collective pressure
   through cumulative impact assessments (CIA) in their implementation of
   the EU Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD). While the MSPD is
   ambiguous on how to approach the assessment of collective pressures, the
   present study is based on a preunderstanding that CIAs are required in
   marine spatial planning (MSP) for two reasons. Firstly, to address all
   relevant human activities and their pressures in order to comply with
   the concept of an `ecosystem-based approach' and to ensure a good
   environmental status. Secondly, indirectly, to ensure that land-sea
   interactions are taken into account. Our results show few and inadequate
   examples of CIA in national MSP processes. Most MSP processes address
   collective pressure through CIA as part of a strategic environmental
   impact assessment. In conclusion, while the MSPD requires MSP to ensure
   collective pressure is kept below a level compatible with good
   environmental status, as part of an ecosystem-based approach, the study
   found few examples of ecosystembased MSP.},

Title = {Post-Construction, Hydromorphological Cumulative Impact Assessment: An
   Approach at the Waterbody Level Integrating Different Spatial Scales},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The environmental impact assessment is a process required in many
   countries. It highlights future activities with a significant impact on
   the environment. Water, as an environmental factor, needs adequate
   methods for quantifying cumulative impact of hydrotechnical works. In
   most cases, for new developments, baseline data is collected before the
   beginning of the construction, but for waterworks already in place, a
   different approach is needed. In line with the EU Water Framework
   Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC), the overall purpose of the research is
   to develop an approach for the hydromorphological cumulative impact
   assessment integrating different spatial scales for existing water
   intakes with transversal barriers on mountain rivers in Romania. Being a
   research study developed for a specific issue-post-construction impact
   assessment, some innovative actions were required. Lack of information
   in the pre-construction phase was an important constraint. Customizing
   formulas of certain indicators established within the Romanian method
   for hydromorphological status assessment of rivers proved to be a
   practical solution to show both local and waterbody hydromorphological
   impact. Upscaling the impact from the local scale to the river sector
   and the waterbody allows awareness of the spatial extent of the impact
   and understanding of the importance of the thresholds of significant
   impact for a broader audience. In order to better highlight the
   approach, this paper shows practical examples. The whole chain of the
   drivers-pressures-state-impacts-responses (DPSIR) framework is applied
   in the case of two river water bodies with hydropower generation
   facilities in place. In addition, some recommendations for actions are
   provided.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment for an urban agglomeration based on a
   relative risk model and multi-media fugacity model: A case study in
   Guangdong province, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {91},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Urban agglomeration, which is an organism with distinct organizational
   characteristics, differs from a single city. In its policy-level
   environmental impact assessment, the ecological and health risks need to
   be addressed in a unified manner, because multiple cities interact and
   influence each other, and the environmental risks have multiple
   elements, multiple processes, and multiple effect interaction and
   superposition. To this end, this study proposed a regional-level
   cumulative risk assessment framework coupling a relative risk model
   (RRM) with a multi-media fugacity model (MFM). The RRM translated the
   risk causal relations into four city-differentiated matrices, which
   consisted of normalized factors (NFs), ranging from 0 to 1, that were
   indicative of the impact intensity and possibility. The MFM was embedded
   into the RRM to generate the NFs. The NFs were multiplied for each
   city-source-endpoint combination to get the overall risk score, and the
   score provided policy references. This framework was applied to
   Guangdong Province of China (GD). As heavy metal contamination is one of
   the GD's major concerns, this study analyzed their cumulative risks due
   to industrialization for the year 2020 and compared the city level and
   industrial level risk scores. The results showed that the central part
   of GD was under the highest risk, with Guangzhou, Foshan, and Jiangmen
   having the highest risk. From the perspective of the risk pressure
   sources, Pb and Cd were the biggest stressors. Non-ferrous/ferrous
   metals mining and processing and metal products manufacturing were the
   major threats. As these industries gain greater footholds in the GD's
   ecologically susceptible region, the relevant policies should be
   elaborately designed before new entrants commence their operations.},

Abstract = {The combined influence on the environment of all projects occurring in a
   single area is evaluated through cumulative impact assessments (CIA),
   which consider the consequences of multiple projects, each insignificant
   on its own, yet important when evaluated collectively. Traditionally,
   future human activities are included in CIA using an analytical
   platform, commonly based on complex models that supply precise
   predictions but with reduced accuracy. To compensate for the lack of
   accuracy in current CIA approaches, we propose a shift in the paradigm
   governing CIA. The paradigm shift involves a change in the focus of CIA
   investigations from the detailed analysis of one unlikely future to the
   identification of the patterns describing multiple potential future
   changes in the environment. To illustrate the approach, a set of 144
   possible and equally likely futures were developed that aimed to
   identify the potential impacts of forest harvesting and petroleum
   drilling on the habitat suitability of moose and marten in northeast
   British Columbia, Canada. The evolution of two measures of habitat
   suitability (average habitat suitability index and surface of the stands
   with habitat suitability index > 0.5) revealed that the human activities
   could induce cycles in the habitat dynamics of moose and marten. The
   planning period of 100 years was separated into three distinct periods
   following a sinusoidal pattern (i.e., increase - constant - decrease in
   the habitat suitability measures). The attributes that could induce
   significant changes in the assessment of environment are the choice of
   harvesting age and species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dietary intake of contaminated food is a major route of human exposure
   to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Despite the prevalence of OCP usage
   in southern Africa for several decades, their impact on
   socioeconomically vulnerable communities remains largely overlooked. We
   investigated the accumulation of OCPs in crops commonly cultivated by
   rural communities surrounding iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa.
   All samples analysed were found to be contaminated, with total OCP
   concentrations ranging between 190 and 240ngg(-1) ww. Elevated levels of
   OCP residues were detected in all products, with the majority of samples
   exceeding European Commission's maximum residue limits (MRLs). We
   combine these results with local OCP fish tissue estimates to assess
   potential dietary risks. Cumulative risk assessment indicated potential
   non-cancer risks associated with heptachlor epoxide, while a cancer risk
   as high as 1 in 10 was found to be associated with aldrin and dieldrin.
   This far exceeds USEPA guidelines and indicates that OCP residues in
   crops and fish from the study area pose a high risk to human health. The
   results of this study call for further attention to be given to the
   health implications of continued OCP use not only within the study area
   but also in Southern Africa in general.},

Abstract = {Systems that allow users to store and retrieve spatial data, provide for
   analyses of spatial data, and offer highly detailed display of spatial
   data are referred to as geographic information systems, or more
   typically, GIS. Since their initial usage in the 1960s, GISs have
   evolved as a means of assembling and analyzing diverse data pertaining
   to specific geographical areas, with spatial locations of the data
   serving as the organizational basis for the information systems. The
   structure of GISs is built around spatial identifiers and the methods
   used to encode data for storage and manipulation. This paper examines
   how GIS has been used in typical environmental assessment, its use for
   cumulative impact assessment, and explores litigation that occurred in
   the United States Federal court system where GIS was used in some aspect
   of cumulative effects. The paper also summarizes fifteen case studies
   that range from area wide transportation planning to wildlife and
   habitat impacts, and draws together a few lessons learned from this
   review of literature and litigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Cumulative health risk estimation for exposure to mixtures is a current
   issue, which would present a useful tool for environmental and public
   health management. Cumulative risks were estimated with response and
   dose addition methods for individual multi-route - multi-pathway
   exposure to trihalomethanes and associated carcinogenic toxic risks in
   Izmir, Turkey. Exposure levels were estimated for ingestion, dermal, and
   inhalation routes using measured tap water and bottled water THM
   concentrations. Drinking, showering, hand and dish washing were the
   considered pathways. THM concentrations in air during the showering were
   modeled with two-resistance theory using tap water concentration data.
   The estimated carcinogenic risk levels for ingestion route were in the
   range of safe (< 10(-6)) to low priority (< 10(-4)), for dermal route
   all were in the safe zone (< 10(-6)), and for inhalation route were in
   the range of safe to high priority (> 10(-4)) zones, indicating
   ingestion and inhalation routes were of similar significance ahead of
   dermal exposure. Cumulative carcinogenic risks of THM compounds were
   estimated using simple (response) addition and dose addition using
   cumulative relative potency factor (CRPF) methods. CRPF method estimated
   the risks at lower levels compared to the simple addition, which
   originated from the use two different risk factor values for the index
   chemical in the method. Cumulative chronic-toxic risks were also
   assessed, rendering below the threshold risk levels for all routes. This
   study showed that multi-route - multi-pathway exposure assessment and
   cumulative risk assessment should together be considered for better
   environmental and public health management.},

Abstract = {The expansion and intensification of marine uses have severe cumulative
   impacts on marine ecosystems and human well-being, unless they are
   properly managed with an ecosystem-based management approach.
   A systematic conservation planning approach, using marxan with zones,
   was applied to generate alternative marine spatial plans for the Aegean
   Sea. Relevant human uses were included and their cumulative impact on a
   wide set of key biodiversity features was considered in the analysis.
   Different cost scenarios were developed to gain insight on the effects
   of the approaches used to assess socio-economic factors, and their
   potential impact on spatial plans.
   The spatial plans generated differed greatly depending on the method
   used to estimate opportunity costs and evaluate human activities in
   monetary terms.
   The vulnerability weights (the relative vulnerability of ecological
   features to specific human activities and their impacts) that were
   estimated based on a cumulative impact assessment, allowed the
   assessment of each zone in contributing to the achievement of

   Results indicate that special care should be given to how socio-economic

   The proposed approach demonstrates how EU member states may effectively

Abstract = {In Australia, Coal Seam Gas (CSG) is a relatively new source of natural
   gas commonly advocated as a lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   alternative to coal. This study investigates how GHG emissions have
   been, and potentially could be, assessed within the Australian CSG
   industry. The research involved a document analysis of several
   Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and consultant reports prepared
   as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for major
   CSG projects in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld). There were
   found to be inconsistencies in the conduct of greenhouse assessment by
   the CSG industry, including how complete and transparent assessments
   were, as well as how effectively they addressed project emission
   intensity and cumulative impacts. There were also found to be large
   inconsistencies between assessments carried out for Qld projects and
   those for NSW projects, likely because of differences in how assessment
   requirements are applied by planning bodies. This study also highlights
   how alternative assessment approaches, such as Cumulative Impact
   Assessment (CIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), have
   potential to enable a broader and more consistent understanding of
   emission sources that cross a range of geographical and project
   boundaries.},

Abstract = {Multiple chemicals are emitted in residential accommodation. Aggregate
   Daily Doses (ADD) (ng/kg-bw/d) w ere estimated for 32 semivolatile
   organic compounds (SVOCs) of different chemical families that are
   frequently detected in French dwellings in both air and settled dust.
   Daily doses were determined using steady-state models for the
   population, categorized into 11 age groups covering birth to age 30.
   Three routes of exposure were taken into account: dust ingestion,
   inhalation (gaseous and particulate phases) and dermal contact with the
   gaseous phase of air. Contamination levels w ere preferentially
   retrieved from large, nationwide representative datasets. A
   two-dimensional probabilistic approach was used to assess parametric
   uncertainty and identify the most in fluential factors. For children
   aged 2 to 3 years, ADD estimates spanned orders o f magnitude, with
   median values ranging from 8.7 pg/kg-bw/d for
   2,2',3,4,4'-pentabromodiphenylether (BDE 85) to 1.3 V mu g/kg-bw/d for
   di-iso-butyl phthalate (DiBP). Inhalation, ingestion and dermal pathway
   contributed at varying levels, and depending on compound, air was the
   dominant medium for 28 of the 32 compounds (either b y inhalation or
   dermal contact). Indoor exposure estimate variance was mainly driven by
   indoor contamination variability, and secondarily by uncertainty in
   physical and chemical parameters. These findings lend support to the
   call for cumulative risk assessment of indoor SVOCs.},

Title = {Making the case for cumulative impacts assessment: Modelling the
   potential impacts of climate change, harvesting, oil and gas, and fire},
Journal = {FORESTRY CHRONICLE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {84},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The cumulative impacts of human and natural activity on forest
   landscapes in Alberta are clear. Human activity, such as forestry and
   oil and gas development, and natural processes such as wildfire leave
   distinctive marks on the composition, age class structure and spatial
   configuration of the forest. Also, other processes such as climate
   change may be slowly and subtly modifying forest dynamics and may lead
   to important changes over time. Given the importance and ubiquitous
   nature of these cumulative impacts, a forest management plan that does
   not adequately take such impacts into account cannot be expected to
   adequately manage the forest, neither its components nor its processes.
   In order to address the question of cumulative impacts in the context of
   forestry, a landscape model was designed and built in order to simulate
   forestry, oil and gas, climate change, wildfire, and demographic change
   for the Whitecourt forest management area over a long time horizon. This
   paper presents the model and the forest landscape states it forecasted
   with cumulative impacts, and evaluates the fate of some key indicators
   of biodiversity and forest productivity Simulations of harvesting as the
   only disturbance, the nearest analogue to the current approach to forest
   management planning, yield results that differ greatly, in every
   respect, from the results of simulations of harvesting combined with
   other disturbance agents. The simulation of multiple disturbance agents
   together allows for the detection of interactions among disturbance
   agents, and indeed, there are important interactions between the
   processes of fire and oil and gas. Results also show that climate and
   demographic change will intensify the impact of fire on the supply of
   timber and other values. Also, the continued development of petroleum
   resources will lead to an important erosion of the forest landbase.
   Overall, this paper makes a strong case for cumulative impacts
   assessment and the use of spatial and temporal stochastic modelling in
   forest management.},

Abstract = {There are 19 barrages constructed on the Indus River to divert water to
   irrigate command areas for crop production and for flood control. The
   Guddu barrage is one such barrages, which requires rehabilitation and is
   the subject of the current study. There are two barrages, Sukkur and
   Kotri which are located downstream of Guddu barrage, whose impacts are
   also considered as part of the cumulative impact assessment. The
   objective of the study is to evaluate the cumulative impact as a result
   of the rehabilitation of the barrage. The construction of barrages and
   diversion of water for irrigation has resulted in negative and positive
   impacts on many valued environmental components including: (i)
   fragmentation of dolphins' habitat and extirpation of dolphins in many
   river sections of the Indus and its tributaries, (ii) restriction of
   hilsa migration has resulted in drastic reduction in commercially
   important hilsa fish catch and its spawning area, and (iii)
   transformation of the arid barren lands of Sindh in to vast agricultural
   lands, which has resulted in significant socioeconomic benefits to
   Sindh.},

Abstract = {We investigated the distribution of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
   tarandus) from aerial surveys in 1986-1998 in 622 contiguous 4-km(2)
   grid squares in relation to density of power lines, roads and ski trails
   in the Nordfjella region, south-central Norway. Density of reindeer was
   significantly lower in developed quadrats compared to undeveloped
   quadrats and decreased with increasing density of development. No
   reindeer were observed in areas exceeding 1.3 km/km(2) of linear
   structures and only 1.1\% of the reindeer were observed in areas
   exceeding 0.8 km/km(2) of linear structures, an area constituting 17\%
   of the study area. The results imply that development, and also the
   degree of development, affect the availability of range for wild
   reindeer. Furthermore. the results suggest that reindeer may abandon
   areas once disturbance exceeds a critical level. We conclude that there
   is a need for cumulative impact assessments of the overall development
   in Norwegian mountain regions, to preserve the last remaining wild
   reindeer populations in Europe.},

Title = {Environmental Flow Assessments Are Not Realizing Their Potential as an
   Aid to Basin Planning},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Multiple planned dams in developing countries, mostly for hydropower,
   are threatening some of the world's great river systems. Concern over
   their social and environmental impacts has led to hydropower being
   excluded from the sustainability term `green energy.' Better planning,
   design and operation of hydropower dams could guide where to build and
   not to build, and how to mitigate some of their negative impacts. Impact
   assessments presently done for dams include Cumulative Impact
   Assessments (CIAs) or similar at the basin level, and Environmental
   Impact Assessments at the project level. These typically do not detail
   how the river ecosystem could change and the implications for its
   dependent social structures. A comprehensive Environmental Flows
   (EFlows) Assessment does provide this information but is almost always
   not linked to the other impact assessments. When done at all, it is
   often rudimentary; rarely basin-wide; and almost always done after major
   development decisions have already been made. A more effective approach
   for any basin targeted for hydropower or other large dam development
   would be to formally and automatically embed the requirement for a
   basin-wide, detailed EFlows Assessment into a CIA. This should be done
   at the earliest stage of planning, before dam sites are selected and
   allocated to developers. The EFlows method adopted matters, as it
   dictates the scope and flexibility of a study. Rapid one-size-fits-all
   methods do not provide the detail that governments and other
   stakeholders need to understand the possible future of their river
   basins, negotiate and make informed decisions.},

Abstract = {Aim As a step towards providing support for an ecological approach to
   strengthening marine protected areas (MPAs) and meeting international
   commitments, this study combines cumulative impact assessment and
   conservation planning approach to undertake a large-scale spatial
   prioritization.
   Location Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Brazil, Southwest Atlantic
   Ocean.
   Methods We developed a prioritization approach to protecting different
   habitat types, threatened species ranges and ecological connectivity,
   while also mitigating the impacts of multiple threats on biodiversity.
   When identifying priorities for conservation, we accounted for the
   co-occurrence of 24 human threats and the distribution of 161 marine
   habitats and 143 threatened species, as well as their associated
   vulnerabilities. Additionally, we compared our conservation priorities
   with MPAs proposed by local stakeholders.
   Results We show that impacts to habitats and species are widespread and
   identify hot spots of cumulative impacts on inshore and offshore areas.
   Industrial fisheries, climate change and land-based activities were the
   most severe threats to biodiversity. The highest priorities were mostly
   found towards the coast due to the high cumulative impacts found in
   nearshore areas. As expected, our systematic approach showed a better
   performance on selecting priority sites when compared to the MPAs
   proposed by local stakeholders without a typical conservation planning
   exercise, increasing the existing coverage of MPAs by only 7.9\%.
   However, we found that proposed MPAs still provide some opportunities to
   protect areas facing high levels of threats.
   Main conclusions The study presents a blueprint of how to embrace a
   comprehensive ecological approach when identifying strategic priorities
   for conservation. We advocate protecting these crucial areas from
   degradation in emerging conservation efforts is key to maintain their
   biodiversity value.},

Abstract = {Notwithstanding its central place in social security policy-making and
   in the experiences of those on the receiving end of welfare reforms,
   cumulative impact is an under interrogated and theorised problem in
   social welfare scholarship. This paper seeks to address this in two
   ways. First, it draws on the lessons of the comparatively well-developed
   literature on cumulative impact in environmental studies to: (i)
   identify different dimensions of cumulative impact and (ii) best
   practices in undertaking cumulative impact assessments. Second, it
   argues that having regard to cumulative impact is not just good
   policy-making, but is also a legal obligation. To discharge the `Public
   Sector Equality Duty' under s.149 Equality Act 2010, a public authority
   needs to have due regard to clear cumulative impacts between measures.
   In the context of social security policy-making, a failure to undertake
   enquiries to establish cumulative impacts between policies is likely to
   breach the PSED. Drawing on examples from the UK Government's Welfare
   Reform Act 2012 and the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 throughout, the
   paper makes the case for both the importance of addressing cumulative
   impact in policymaking, and the need for greater interrogation by social
   welfare scholarship.},

Title = {Targeted and suspect screening of plasticizers in house dust to assess
   cumulative human exposure risk},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {781},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Indoor dust is an important exposure route to anthropogenic chemicals
   used in consumer products. Plasticizers are common product additives and
   can easily leach out of the product and partition to dust.
   Investigations of plasticizers typically focus on a subset of phthalate
   esters (PEs), but there are many more PEs in use, and alternative
   plasticizers (APs) are seeing greater use after recognition of adverse
   health effects of PEs. In this study we use full scan high resolution
   mass spectrometry for targeted and suspect screening of PEs and APs in
   house dust and to assess the potential risk of human exposure. House
   dust samples from Eastern Slovakia were investigated and concentrations
   of Sigma 12PEs and Sigma(5)APs ranged 12-2765 mu g/g and 45-13,260 mu
   g/g, respectively. APs were at similar levels to PEs, indicating common
   usage of these compounds in products in homes.
   Evaluation of individual compound toxicity combined with human intake
   via dust ingestion suggested PEs are of lower priority compared to
   semivolatile organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls due to
   their lower toxicity. However, cumulative risk assessment (CRA) is a
   more appropriate evaluation of risk, considering the presences of many
   PEs in dust and their similar toxic mode of action. CRA based on median
   toxicity reference values (TRVs) suggested acceptable risks for dust
   ingestion, however, the wide range of literature-derived TRVs is a large
   uncertainty, especially for the APs. Use of newer TRVs suggest risk from
   dust ingestion alone, i.e. not even considering diet, inhalation, and
   dermal contact. Additionally, screening of full-scan instrumental
   spectra identified a further 40 suspect PE compounds, suggesting the CRA
   based on the 12 target PEs underestimates the risk. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Abstract = {As global biodiversity is facing an existential threat, integration of
   biodiversity concerns into decision-making tools like EIA is more urgent
   now. Biodiversity impact assessment of Indira Sagar and Omkareshwar dams
   on the river Narmada that were conducted during 1990-94 is
   retrospectively analyzed to demonstrate the utility of the Habitat
   Evaluation Procedure as a quantitative method and its capability to
   predict long-term trends in habitat quality. Results of a multiple
   scenario simulation on habitat quality change over thirty years
   (1991-2020) indicate that there still exists an opportunity to conserve
   the biodiversity in the region by enhancing the protection status of the
   forests surrounding the dam reservoirs and proper resettlement and
   rehabilitation of project affected population. Further, limitations of
   Indian EIA with reference to biodiversity integration into Mitigation
   Hierarchy, Cumulative Impacts Assessment, Governance, SEA and post-audit
   are addressed. Indian policy needs to integrate biodiversity into
   earlier stages of decision making, not only to achieve its 2030 SDG
   targets, but also to ensure ecological security which is essential for
   the long-term socio-economic development of the nation.},

Abstract = {Studies have documented cumulative health effects of chemical and
   nonchemical exposures, particularly chronic environmental and social
   stressors. Environmental justice groups have advocated for community
   participation in research that assesses how these interactions
   contribute to health disparities experienced by low-income and
   communities of color. In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   issued a request for research applications (RFA), Understanding the Role
   of Nonchemical Stressors and Developing Analytic Methods for Cumulative
   Risk Assessments. Seven research projects were funded to help address
   this knowledge gap. Each engaged with communities in different ways. We
   describe the community engagement approaches of the seven research
   projects, which ranged from outreach through shared
   leadership/participatory. We then assess the experiences of these
   programs with respect to the community engagement goals of the RFA. We
   present insights from these community engagement efforts, including how
   the grants helped to build or enhance the capacity of community
   organizations in addition to contributing to the research projects. Our
   analysis of project proposals, annual grantee reports, and participant
   observation of these seven projects suggests guidelines for the
   development of future funding mechanisms and for conducting
   community-engaged research on cumulative risk involving environmental
   and social stressors including: 1) providing for flexibility in the mode
   of community engagement; 2) addressing conflict between research timing
   and engagement needs, 3) developing approaches for communicating about
   the uniquely sensitive issues of nonchemical stressors and social risks;
   and 4) encouraging the evaluation of community engagement efforts.},

Abstract = {Using alternative future scenarios in development planning supports the
   integration of diverse perspectives and the joint consideration of the
   needs of humans and nature. Here, we report on the use of scenarios as
   an integral part of a two-year sustainable development planning process
   for Andros Island, The Bahamas. We combined qualitative and quantitative
   approaches to link stakeholder visions of the future of their island
   with quantitative assessments of the likely impacts of those visions on
   future conditions. We highlight knowledge gains for scenarios in three
   key areas: (1) inclusion of participatory mapping as both a mechanism
   for eliciting stakeholder knowledge and aspirations, and as an input for
   risk assessment; (2) participation of a transdisciplinary team to guide
   the scenario creation process and enable better understanding of the
   range of stakeholder visions and values; and (3) use of cumulative risk
   assessment as a framework to bring together quantitative and qualitative
   information and provide objective comparisons between alternatives. We
   convened over 560 people in 35 meetings and worked with 13 government
   ministries to create and compare four alternative scenarios consisting
   of storylines and maps of habitat risk of degradation. We found that one
   scenario, featuring intensive development, would pose the greatest risk
   to habitats and worked together to understand which activities could
   lead to such a future and what interventions could be taken to help
   avoid it. Ultimately, our collaborative process yielded objective
   comparisons between alternative future scenarios, incorporated diverse
   visions and values of stakeholders into the island-wide master plan, and
   informed investments in the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems
   and infrastructure critical for the livelihoods of island communities.
   This process can serve as an example for scientists and practitioners
   worldwide seeking to use scenarios to inform sustainable development
   planning.},

Title = {A risk-based framework for assessing the cumulative impact of multiple
   fisheries},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Effective conservation of marine ecosystems requires the assessment and
   management of cumulative impacts of multiple activities occurring in the
   ecosystem. Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used
   tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine
   ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other
   risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of
   multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to
   incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative
   risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this
   extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the
   coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the
   original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2\%) were
   scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31\%) are at low risk from
   all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk
   posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the
   proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3\%, whereas the
   proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21\%. For 13 species, the
   high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the
   5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which
   accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of
   further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis
   demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative
   impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of
   coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple
   fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the
   possible outcomes of management alternatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Health risks to dietary neonicotinoids are low for Chinese residents
   based on an analysis of 13 daily-consumed foods},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Neonicotinoid pesticide residues are ubiquitous in various foodstuffs
   and may adversely affect human health. We performed a nationwide survey
   of neonicotinoid residues in foodstuffs collected from Chinese markets
   and evaluated the risks of chronic and acute exposure in 1-6-year-old
   children and the general population. Among the 3406 samples of 13
   commodities, 62.21\% contained neonicotinoids with concentrations
   ranging from 0.1 to 1471.43 mu g/kg, and 37.58\% were simultaneously
   contaminated with 2-7 neonicotinoids. Acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and
   imidacloprid were the top three detected neonicotinoids (22.14-34.32\%
   of samples). Chronic and acute cumulative risk assessment using the
   relative potency factor method revealed that exposure to neonicotinoids
   was within established safety limits (below 1); however, the acute risk
   was much greater than the chronic risk (chronic hazard index range, 1.40
   x 10(-6)-2.33 x 10(-3); acute hazard index range, 1.75 x 10(-6)-0.15). A
   relatively greater acute cumulative risk was found for children with
   respect to consumption of grapes, mandarins, and cowpeas (acute hazard
   index range, 0.11-0.15). Despite the low health risk, the potential
   health hazards of neonicotinoids should be continuously assessed, given
   their ubiquity and cumulative effects.},

Title = {Framework for assessing the impact of human activities on the
   environment: the impact of forest harvesting and petroleum drilling on
   habitat of moose (Alces alces) and marten (Martens americana)},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {933-955},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The environmental changes induced by projects occurring in an area are
   evaluated by cumulative impact assessments (CIA), which consider the
   consequences of multiple projects, each insignificant on its own, yet
   important when evaluated collectively. When future human activities are
   of interest, the proposed activities are included in CIA using an
   analytical platform that can supply precise predictions but with
   asymptotically null accuracy. To compensate for the lack of accuracy we
   propose a shift in the paradigm governing CIA. The paradigm shift
   advocates a change in the focus of CIA investigations from the detailed
   analysis of one unlikely future to the identification of patterns
   describing the future changes in the environment. To illustrate the
   paradigm shift, a set of 144 possible and equally likely futures were
   developed and used to identify the potential impacts of forest
   harvesting and petroleum drilling on the habitat of moose and marten.
   The univariate and multivariate analysis of two measures of habitat,
   namely average habitat suitability index (HSI) and surface of the stands
   with HSI > 0.5, revealed at least three distinct periods in the next 100
   years. Multivariate analysis also showed that habitat quality is of
   immediate importance and marten is sensitive during the first third of
   the century. Our findings indicate that the spatial and temporal
   arrangement of the human disturbances could be more important than the
   magnitude of the disturbance. The attributes associated with significant
   environmental changes are harvesting age and the investigated
   environmental elements of an ecosystem, in this case the species
   habitat.},

Title = {Setting the scene for a multi-map toolset supporting maritime spatial
   planning by mapping relative cumulative impacts on ecosystem service
   supply},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide the foundations for the development
   of a spatial decision-support toolset that combines cumulative impacts
   and ecosystem service supply assessments to support what-if scenario
   analysis in a maritime spatial planning context. Specifically, a
   conceptual framework for a toolset has been designed in order to
   introduce a new approach for place-based assessments of change in
   relative ecosystem service supply in multiple services at a time due to
   changes in cumulative impacts. Central to the toolset are two
   pre-existing approaches for relative ecosystem service supply and
   cumulative impact assessments and tools that facilitate them. The tools
   take advantage of available data from various sources, including geodata
   and expert knowledge, and have already been proven to support maritime
   spatial planning in a real-world context. To test the new approach and
   demonstrate the outputs, an ecosystem service supply assessment was done
   manually using the two currently separate tools. The results of the test
   case ecosystem service supply assessment for the Gulf of Riga in the
   Baltic Sea are also presented in this paper and illustrate the
   assessment steps and data needs. Although presently the focus of the
   illustrative assessment is the Gulf of Riga, the toolset will be able to
   accommodate analysis of cumulative impacts and service supply of any
   location, leaving the scope of the assessment to be determined by the
   objectives of the assessment as well as data availability (i.e.,
   geospatial data availability and extent of expert knowledge).},

Abstract = {This paper briefly summarizes some of the regional developments and
   advances in the theme ``Tools for Integrated Policy and Management{''}
   that were presented at the October 2009 Gulf of Maine Science Symposium
   held in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. Tools for integrated policy and
   management meet a wide range of functions and originate from a variety
   of fields, from the physical and biological sciences to social sciences
   and organizational studies. Some of the tools presented at the 2009 Gulf
   of Maine symposium are discussed in this paper. Knowledge gaps still
   exist regarding impacts of development and industrial activities, which
   becomes apparent when trying to evaluate and quantify cumulative
   impacts. Geographic information system-based tools and elements of
   marine spatial planning such as human use mapping can help establish
   better cumulative impact assessments. While it is recognized that
   advances in integrated policy and management have occurred since the
   previous (1996) Gulf of Maine science symposium, evaluation of that
   progress is still in development. Tools such as state of the environment
   reporting, integrated assessments/ecosystem overviews, frameworks for
   implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM), or approaches
   developed by the EBM Tools Network all assist in measuring and
   evaluating our progress towards full implementation of an ecosystem
   approach within the context of management activities and actions.},

Title = {Effects of the Ionic Liquid {[}BMIM]Cl on the Baltic Microphytobenthic
   Communities},

Abstract = {Ionic liquids (IL) are regarded as the solution to the modern world's
   need to create and use compounds that exhibit a range of desirable
   properties while having a low environmental impact. However, recent
   reports are shattering the image of ionic liquids as environmentally
   friendly substances, especially in relation to the aquatic environment,
   revealing their potentially toxic effects. To assess the potential
   environmental impact of ILs, we conducted an experiment involving
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ({[}BMIM]Cl), a substance
   considered to be the least hazardous among the imidazolium chloride ILs,
   on Baltic microphytobenthic communities. Microphytobenthos collected
   from the environment was tested under controlled laboratory conditions,
   and both the cell counts and the chloroplast condition were used as
   endpoints. It was shown that {[}BMIM]Cl at concentrations of 10(-3) and
   10(-2), considered safe based on a cumulative impact assessment, has a
   negative effect on the condition of the microalgal cells and causes a
   reduction in population size. Although, under the influence of
   {[}BMIM]Cl, only a small proportion of the species was eliminated from
   the communities, only two species among those important to the
   communities showed resistance to this compound and eventually began to
   dominate the communities.},

Title = {Integrating cumulative impacts into strategic environmental
   decision-making: Tourism development in Belek, Turkey},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the cumulative impacts of strategic proposals and
   projects, and searches how cumulative impact assessment (CIA) can be
   integrated into strategic decision-making. It reviews the CIA literature
   to address the shortcomings of impact assessments at both strategic and
   project levels. Subsequently, it suggests a synthesized approach
   bringing disturbance ecology and adaptive ecosystem approaches together
   to identify and predict impacts even in challenging data contexts. To
   illustrate how the synthesized approach can be utilized in CIA
   integration, it provides a case study from Turkey. The Belek tourism
   development plan is investigated by using the soft system methodology.
   Comparison of the actual and hypothetical situations of the case
   illustrates the possible and desirable changes to improve strategic
   decision-making. Accordingly, the paper addresses the key role of
   decision makers' mindsets and approaches to utilizing experience-based
   and science-based knowledges in considering cumulative impacts at the
   strategic level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Occurrence and health risk of pesticide residues in Chinese herbal
   medicines from Shandong Province, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 16},
Abstract = {Pesticide residue was one of the stress factors affecting quality and
   safety of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs). The present study was
   designed to investigate the occurrence and dietary exposure of 70
   pesticide residues in 307 samples of CHMs, including 104 American
   ginseng, 100 Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum), and 103 Dendrobium
   officinale (D. officinale) in Shandong Province, China. The study
   revealed that a total of 29 pesticides were detected in the majority
   (92.5\%) of samples, and the pesticide residues of 85 (27.7\%) samples
   exceeded the maximum residue levels (MRLs). Particularly, the maximum
   concentration of chlorpyrifos was 23.8 mg kg-1, almost 50 times of the
   MRLs in food in GB 2763-2021, while there's no standard restrictions
   specified in CHMs in China. The chronic, acute, and cumulative risk
   assessment results indicated that risk exposure of the three types of
   CHMs were unlikely to pose a health risk to consumers. However, more
   attention should be paid to the multiple residues with the presence of
   four or more pesticides in one sample and high over-standard rate of
   pesticides. The pesticide users and the government should pay more
   attention to the pesticides used in CHMs and regularly monitor the
   presence of these compounds. The study recommended the MRLs of these
   pesticides in CHMs should be established and perfected by the relevant
   departments in China.},

Title = {Organophosphate pesticide dose estimation from spot and 24-hr urine
   samples collected from children in an agricultural community},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Spot urine samples are often used to assess exposure to
   organophosphate (OP) pesticides in place of ``gold standard{''} 24-hr
   samples, which are cumbersome to collect. Assessment of non-persistent
   chemicals using spot urine samples may result in exposure
   misclassification that could bias epidemiological analyses towards the
   null. Few studies have examined the validity of measurements of urinary
   metabolites in spot samples to estimate daily OP dose or the potential
   implications of reliance on spot samples for risk assessments.
   Objective: Examine the validity of using first morning void (FMV) and
   random non-FMV urine samples to estimate cumulative 24-hr OP pesticide
   dose among children living in an agricultural region.
   Methods: We collected urine samples over 7 consecutive days, including
   two 24-hr samples, from 25 children living in an agricultural community.
   We used measurements of urinary dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites, data
   on nearby agricultural pesticide applications, and daily dietary intake
   data to estimate internal dose from exposure to a mixture of OP
   pesticides according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   Cumulative Risk Assessment guidelines. Dose estimates from volumeand
   creatinine-adjusted same-day FMV and non-FMV spot urine samples were
   compared to the ``gold standard{''} estimates from 24-hr samples.
   Results: Non-FMV samples had relatively weak ability to predict 24-hr
   dose (R-2 = 0.09-0.38 for total DAPs) and tended to underestimate the
   percentage of samples exceeding regulatory guidelines. Models with FMV
   samples or the average of an FMV and non-FMV sample were similarly
   predictive of 24-hr estimates (R-2 for DAPs = 0.40-0.68 and 0.40-0.80,
   respectively, depending on volume adjustment method).
   Conclusion: Reliance on non-FMV samples for risk assessments may
   underestimate daily OP dose and the percentage of children with dose
   estimates exceeding regulatory guidelines. If 24-hr urine sample
   collection is infeasible, we recommend future studies prioritize the
   collection of FMV samples to most accurately characterize OP dose in
   children.},

Title = {Habitat risk assessment for regional ocean planning in the US Northeast

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Coastal habitats provide important benefits to people, including habitat
   for species targeted by fisheries and opportunities for tourism and
   recreation. Yet, such human activities also can imperil these habitats
   and undermine the ecosystem services they provide to people. Cumulative
   risk assessment provides an analytical framework for synthesizing the
   influence of multiple stressors across habitats and decision-support for
   balancing human uses and ecosystem health. To explore cumulative risk to
   habitats in the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Planning regions,
   we apply the open-source InVEST Habitat Risk Assessment model to 13
   habitats and 31 stressors in an exposure-consequence framework. In doing
   so, we advance the science priorities of EBM and both regional planning
   bodies by synthesizing the wealth of available data to improve our
   understanding of human uses and how they affect marine resources. We
   find that risk to ecosystems is greatest first, along the coast, where a
   large number of stressors occur in close proximity and secondly, along
   the continental shelf, where fewer, higher consequence activities occur.
   Habitats at greatest risk include soft and hard-bottom nearshore areas,
   tidal flats, soft-bottom shelf habitat, and rocky intertidal zones-with
   the degree of risk varying spatially. Across all habitats, our results
   indicate that rising sea surface temperatures, commercial fishing, and
   shipping consistently and disproportionally contribute to risk. Further,
   our findings suggest that management in the nearshore will require
   simultaneously addressing the temporal and spatial overlap as well as
   intensity of multiple human activities and that management in the
   offshore requires more targeted efforts to reduce exposure from specific
   threats. We offer a transparent, generalizable approach to evaluating
   cumulative risk to multiple habitats and illustrate the spatially
   heterogeneous nature of impacts along the eastern Atlantic coast and the
   importance of spatial scale in estimating such impacts. These results
   offer a valuable decision-support tool by helping to constrain the
   decision space, focus attention on habitats and locations at the
   greatest risk, and highlight effect management strategies.},

Title = {Cumulative effects of offshore renewables: From pragmatic policies to
   holistic marine spatial planning tools},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To alleviate climate change consequences, the UK government is
   pioneering offshore renewable energy de-velopments at an ever-increasing
   pace. The North Sea is a dynamic ecosystem with strong
   bottom-up/top-down natural and anthropogenic drivers facing rapid
   climate change impacts. To ensure the compatibility of such large-scale
   developments with nature conservation obligations, regulatory processes
   set out that all effects need to be evaluated through cumulative impact
   assessments (CIA). However, by excluding climate change impacts and
   bottom-up effects of renewable developments, the CIA lacks
   spatio-temporal baselines linking oceanic ecosystem indicators to
   population dynamics, leading to uncertain predictions at population
   levels. CIA is currently required in Europe under the Strategic
   Environmental Assessment and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive
   (MSFD), suggesting that these two policy areas should be more closely
   aligned. This study presents an overview of the current CIA policy
   framework, enabling an ecosystem-based approach linking lower ecosystem
   components to top-predator populations using the UK as a case study. At
   the UK level, CIA requirements mirror the EU ones under the Marine and
   Coastal Access Act, the UK Marine Policy Statement, and the UK National
   Policy Statement. Firstly, we show how CIA and MSFD requirements are
   integrated into the UK licensing and maritime planning frameworks.
   Secondly, we provide policy pathways embedding the MSFD as a baseline
   for CIAs with European and UK regulations. Thirdly, we propose a
   framework encompassing a shared monitoring effort, an ecosystem
   modelling approach connected with two existing online databases
   supported with funds from Contracts for Difference. This integrated
   approach will enable a holistic and pragmatic ecosystem-based framework
   for more accurate and rapid methods for producing CIAs for offshore
   renewable energy developments.},

Title = {Human health risk assessment of pesticide residues in honeysuckle
   samples from different planting bases in China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {759},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {The buds and initial flowers of honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.)
   are most widely used in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). In recent
   years, the problem of pesticide residues in honeysuckle has attracted
   much attention. This research aimed to study pesticide residual
   situation of honeysuckle in China and estimate the potential health
   risks for consumers using the HQ (hazard quotient) and HI (hazard index)
   methods. A reliable and robust method was established to determine and
   quantify 137 pesticide residues simultaneously by highperformance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for 151 honeysuckle
   samples from different planting bases in China in 2017 and 2018.
   Fifty-four pesticides were detected in total, including 10 unauthorized
   pesticides (chlorpyrifos, fipronil, carbofuran, omethoate,
   isofenphos-methyl, triazophos, methomyl, dimethoate, methidathion, and
   methamidophos). One hundred and fifty (99.3\%) samples contained at
   least 1 and up to 31 pesticides and/or their metabolites, with
   concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 3.087mg/kg. Carbendazim,
   chlorbenzuron, imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, and acetamipridwere themost
   frequently detected pesticides in 2017 and 2018, and the corresponding
   detection rates were 95.31\%, 64.06\%, 65.63\%, 53.13\%, 57.81\%, and
   98.85\%, 88.51\%, 70.11\%, 77.01\%, 57.47\%, respectively. The acute
   hazard quotient (HQ(a)) of carbofuran was 1.54 for specific population
   (fetus, infants, and pregnant or nursing women), which indicated that it
   posed a potential acute health risk. In the cumulative risk assessment,
   the acute hazard index (HIa) of insecticides in honesuckle for children
   and the specific populationwere 1.34 and 3.36, respectively, suggesting
   that they posed potential acute cumulative health risks. These results
   were of theoretical and practical value for evaluating the safety of
   honeysuckle and improving its quality and safety. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl phosphonic and phosphinic acids (PFPAs and PFPiAs) are
   sub-groups of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that have been
   commercialized since the 1970s, particularly as defoamers in pesticide
   formulations and wetting agents in consumer products. Recently, C-4/C-4
   PFPiA and its derivatives have been presented as alternatives to
   long-chain PFASs in certain applications. In this study, we
   systematically assess the publicly available information on the
   hazardous properties, occurrence, and exposure routes of PFPAs and
   PFPiAs, and make comparisons to the corresponding properties of their
   better-known carboxylic and sulfonic acid analogs (i.e. PFCAs and
   PFPAs). This comparative assessment indicates that {[}i] PFPAs likely
   have high persistence and long-range transport potential; {[}ii] PFPiAs
   may transform to PFPAs (and possibly PFCAs) in the environment and
   biota; {[}iii] certain PFPAs and PFPiAs can only be slowly eliminated
   from rainbow trout and rats, similarly to long-chain PFCAs and PFPAs;
   {[}iv] PFPAs and PFPiAs have modes-of-action that are both similar to,
   and different from, those of PFCAs and PFSAs; and {[}v] the measured
   levels of PFPAs/PFPiAs in the global environment and biota appear to be
   low in comparison to PFCAs and PFPAs, suggesting, for the time being,
   low risks from PFPAs and PFPiAs alone. Although risks from individual
   PFPAs/PFPiAs are currently low, their ongoing production and use and
   high persistence will lead to increasing exposure and risks over time.
   Furthermore, simultaneous exposure to PFPAs, PFPiAs and other PFASs may
   result in additive effects necessitating cumulative risk assessments. To
   facilitate effective future research, we highlight possible strategies
   to overcome sampling and analytical challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Bird collision assessments are generally made at the scale of a single
   wind farm. While especially in offshore situations such assessments
   already hold several assumptions, even bigger challenges exist on
   estimating the cumulative impact of multiple wind farms and the impacts
   at population level. In this paper, the number of collision victims at
   Belgian offshore wind farms was estimated with a (theoretical) collision
   risk model based on technical turbine specifications, bird-related
   parameters and bird density data of both local seabirds and passerine
   migrants. Bird density data were gathered by visual censuses and radar
   registrations. The outcome of the model was extrapolated to future
   development scenarios in the Belgian part of the North Sea and in the
   entire North Sea, and then further used for a preliminary assessment of
   the impact at population level for the species at risk. The results
   indicate that the cumulative impact of a realistic scenario of 10,000
   turbines in the North Sea might have a significant negative effect at
   population level for lesser and great black-backed gull. We further show
   that during a single night of intense songbird migration, the number of
   collision victims among passerine migrants might be in the order of
   magnitude of several thousands in the entire North Sea. We argue that it
   is of great importance to further develop methods to quantify the
   uncertainties and to minimise the assumptions, in order to assure more
   reliable cumulative impact assessments.},

Title = {Scenario-model-parameter: a new method of cumulative risk uncertainty
   analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {247-261},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The recently developed concepts of aggregate risk and cumulative risk
   rectify two limitations associated with the classical risk assessment
   paradigm established in the early 1980s. Aggregate exposure denotes the
   amount of one pollutant available at the biological exchange boundaries
   from multiple routes of exposure. Cumulative risk assessment is defined
   as an assessment of risk from the accumulation of a common toxic effect
   from all routes of exposure to multiple chemicals sharing a common
   mechanism of toxicity. Thus, cumulative risk constitutes an improvement
   over the classical risk paradigm, which treats exposures from multiple
   routes as independent events associated with each specific route. Risk
   assessors formulate complex models and identify many realistic scenarios
   of exposure that enable them to estimate risks from exposures to
   multiple pollutants and multiple routes. The increase in complexity of
   the risk assessment process is likely to increase risk uncertainty.
   Despite evidence that scenario and model uncertainty contribute to the
   overall uncertainty of cumulative risk estimates, present uncertainty
   analysis of risk estimates accounts only for parameter uncertainty and
   excludes model and scenario uncertainties. This paper provides a
   synopsis of the risk assessment evolution and associated uncertainty
   analysis methods. This evolution leads to the concept of the scenario -
   model- parameter (SMP) cumulative risk uncertainty analysis method. The
   SMP uncertainty analysis is a multiple step procedure that assesses
   uncertainty associated with the use of judiciously selected scenarios
   and models of exposure and risk. Ultimately, the SMP uncertainty
   analysis method compares risk uncertainty estimates determined using all
   three sources of uncertainty with conventional risk uncertainty
   estimates obtained using only the parameter source. An example of
   applying the SMP uncertainty analysis to cumulative risk estimates from
   exposures to two pesticides indicates that inclusion of scenario and
   model sources increases uncertainty of risk estimates relative to those
   estimated using only the parameter source. Changes in uncertainty
   magnitude may affect decisions made by risk managers. (C) 2002 Published

Title = {Collaborative community development in mining regions: The Calama Plus
   and Creo Antofagasta programs in Chile},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The mining industry is widely criticized for its corporate community
   development strategies, which led to accusations of greenwash and low
   social legitimacy. This problem identified led to the following research
   question: What model of community relations allows companies to generate
   shared value, in a broad sense, and create long-term relationships with
   communities? In order to answer the question posed, this paper explores
   the innovative experiences of the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta
   programs in the Antofagasta region of Chile. Calama Plus is an ongoing
   public-private program (2012-2025) established to combat declining
   standards of living in the city. Creo Antofagasta is also an ongoing
   public-private program (2013-2035), which is designed to confront the
   challenges of rapid growth in the city. Based on these two case studies,
   their underlying model (i.e., the collaborative community development
   model) was systematized for this study. The main innovative aspects of
   the model are its focus on the long-term, its concentration on
   territory- oriented projects, and its multi-stakeholder governance
   structure. The latter characteristic implies a collaboration between
   several companies and even between competitors. Drawing on a
   collaborative governance framework, the aim of this paper is to
   extensively describe the companies' perspective on the following: the
   innovative aspects of the model, the drivers required for companies to
   participate, how companies can specifically contribute to these
   programs, and its critical management issues. New drivers and critical
   management issues are identified and discussed in this research, which
   represent a contribution to the collaborative governance framework.
   Since the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs' focus is long-term,
   ending in 2025 and 2035 respectively, their impact has not been
   evaluated. For this reason, we include a discussion on the cumulative
   impact assessment perspective needed for these collaborative community
   development programs, placing particular attention on the controversial
   relationship between mining and local development. This approach is
   based on the assessment of cross-sector partnership results, its impact
   on the balance of social, environmental and economic capitals, and on
   the creation of broadly shared value in terms of long-term
   socio-economic capability building. Finally, policy implications and the
   potential for applying this model to other contexts are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Environmental impact assessments for new Arctic infrastructure do not
   adequately consider the likely long-term cumulative effects of climate
   change and infrastructure to landforms and vegetation in areas with
   ice-rich permafrost, due in part to lack of long-term environmental
   studies that monitor changes after the infrastructure is built. This
   case study examines long-term (1949???2020) climate-and road-related
   changes in a network of ice-wedge polygons, Prudhoe Bay Oilfield,
   Alaska. We studied four trajectories of change along a heavily traveled
   road and a relatively remote site. During 20 years prior to the oilfield
   development, the climate and landscapes changed very little. During 50
   years after development, climate-related changes included increased
   numbers of thermokarst ponds, changes to ice-wedge-polygon morphology,
   snow distribution, thaw depths, dominant vegetation types, and shrub
   abundance. Road dust strongly affected plant-community structure and
   composition, particularly small forbs, mosses, and lichens. Flooding
   increased permafrost degradation, polygon center-trough elevation
   contrasts, and vegetation productivity. It was not possible to isolate
   infrastructure impacts from climate impacts, but the combined datasets
   provide unique insights into the rate and extent of ecological
   disturbances associated with infrastructure-affected landscapes under
   decades of climate warming. We conclude with recommendations for future
   cumulative impact assessments in areas with ice-rich permafrost.},

   imidacloprid, caffeine, bisphenol A (BPA), diclofenac and ibuprofen.
   Tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), tris-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate
   (TPhP), perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFOS)
   and paracetamol were also in many samples but at low concentrations. The
   contaminants' levels showed similar values in both cities. However,
   pesticide levels were significantly higher in surface water (p < 0.05)
   and lower in natural vegetation (p < 0.05) of Riyadh than those of
   Al-Jubail. The risk assessment for the aquatic biota showed that
   abamectin, diazinon (pesticides), bisphenol A and caffeine (PPCPs) had
   the highest risk levels. The cumulative risk assessment showed that the
   contaminant mixture in all water samples is of concern. As far as the
   risk to human health is concerned, individual contaminants did not show
   a significant hazard for the population. However, OPFRs and pesticide
   requires a closed monitoring since \% of admissible daily intakes (ADIs)
   or reference doses (RfD) are high. This is one of the most comprehensive
   study covering environmental and human risk assessment of emerging
   contaminants carried out in Saudi Arabia. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {From the time it appeared in the 1978 regulations implementing the
   United States' National Environmental Policy Act, agencies have
   struggled with the concept of cumulative impacts in their environmental
   analyses. Although the regulations touch on every aspect of
   environmental impact analysis, they merely define cumulative impacts and
   then refer to them only in other definitions in the Terminology section.
   Agencies have become fairly adept at analyzing direct and indirect
   effects, but cumulative impacts have posed more difficult methodological
   problems, giving rise to a host of legal challenges. The courts have
   attempted to sort out what is required for adequate cumulative impact
   analysis, causing agencies to reactively develop agencys-pecific, and
   often complex, methodologies. This article relates the basic concepts of
   cumulative impact assessment to emerging case law, focusing on US
   federal land management issues. From this basis, it proposes a novel
   approach to cumulative effects analysis that (1) uses the doctrine of
   proximate cause from tort law to ensure that there is a reasonable
   probability that a proposal will affect a resource of concern before
   undertaking analysis of other effects on that resource, and (2) uses the
   No Action Alternative's trajectory of resource conditions (which
   incorporates the effects of other past, present, and reasonably
   foreseeable future actions) as the baseline for assessing an action's
   incremental effects. The proposed six-step process integrates effects
   analysis by describing the overall effects of the No Action Alternative,
   altered by an action's direct and indirect (or incremental) effects, as
   the cumulative effect on a particular resource of concern.},

Abstract = {Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is the process of systematically
   assessing a proposed action's cumulative environmental effects in the
   context of past, present, and future actions, regardless of who
   undertakes such actions. Previous studies have examined CIA efforts at
   the federal level but little is known about how states assess the
   cumulative impacts of nonfederal projects. By examining state
   environmental review statutes, administrative rules, agency-prepared
   materials, and a national survey of the administrators of state
   environmental review programs, this study identifies the legal and
   administrative frameworks for CIA. It examines current CIA practice,
   discusses the relationship between CIA policy and its implementation,
   and explores the opportunities for improvement. The results of the study
   show that twenty-nine state environmental review programs across
   twenty-six states required the assessment of cumulative environmental
   impacts. More than half of these programs have adopted specific
   procedures for implementing their policies. Some programs assessed
   cumulative impacts using a standard review document, and others have
   created their own documentations incorporated into applications for
   state permits or funding. The majority of programs have adopted various
   scales, baselines, significance criteria, and coordination practices in
   their CIA processes. Mixed methods were generally used for data
   collection and analysis; qualitative methods were more prevalent than
   quantitative methods. The results also suggest that a program with
   comprehensive and consistent environmental review policies and
   procedures does not always imply extensive CIA requirements and
   practices. Finally, this study discusses the potential for improving
   existing CIA processes and promoting CIA efforts in states without
   established environmental review programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The regulation of groundwater extraction has shifted, almost
   seismically, through Australia's water reform era, which culminated in
   the National Water Initiative and the federal Water Act 2007 (Cth). Its
   starting point was minimal regulation, targeted at controlling selected
   extractions and pursuing sustainability for consumptive purposes. Since
   then, groundwater laws have imported regulatory concepts from the
   surface water sphere; among them, regulating extraction through
   statutory plans and in a broad-based way, and protecting dependent
   ecosystems. One issue emerges at the heart of both the history and
   future of groundwater reform: dealing with the cumulative impacts of
   extraction. This article reviews how groundwater reforms in Australia
   have approached cumulative impacts - albeit often implicitly rather than
   explicitly measured against concepts of cumulative impact assessment
   derived from the scientific environmental assessment literature. It
   finds that both regulatory and non-regulatory, incentive-based measures
   have been used. As water reforms have progressed, arrangements for
   assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of groundwater extraction
   have taken a dramatically broader view of potentially affected natural
   systems, as well as consumptive values. However, they have not focused
   significantly on the implications of connections between natural
   systems. Reforms have also resulted in a much broader view of the
   impacting activities that are relevant to an assessment of cumulative
   impacts, though often with an unclear temporal scope. Remaining
   weaknesses in approaches to managing cumulative impacts and a lack of
   empirical evidence as to the effectiveness of existing measures warrant
   attention. The article concludes by charting key challenges that remain
   for resolution, and setting out an accompanying research and reform
   agenda.},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Environmental changes and their consequences on biodiversity are known
   to have far-reaching effects on the resilience of animal populations and
   associated livelihoods around the world. To counteract negative
   demographic and economic effects on pastoralism, knowledge about the
   historical and current status of the environment is essential. In this
   study, we show how extractive industries, especially large-scale mining,
   induced a cascade of land conversions which are affecting animal
   populations and pastoralists' adaptive responses in northern Sweden. We
   examine social-ecological vulnerability in Arctic reindeer husbandry by
   integrating herders' knowledge, population statistics for
   semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus, public data on
   socio-economic variables and geospatial tools. We determine that
   approximately 34\% of Laevas reindeer herding community's grazing
   grounds are functionally unavailable to reindeer at present due to the
   accumulation of multiple competing land use pressures. Reindeer numbers
   currently only remain stable due to increased management efforts.
   Moreover, we identified current hotspots of high cumulative impact and
   mineral exploration as the spatially dominating land use factor in this
   area. Our approach and results provide new insights for scientifically
   robust cumulative impact assessments of anthropogenic stressors by
   creating a baseline of current developments via a combination of
   reindeer herder's knowledge with historical data of trends and extents
   of human activity over the last century.},

Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-45},

Abstract = {As oil and gas development increases in western states, states are
   responding at different speeds to protect human health and the
   environment. Colorado and Wyoming are recognized as having taken
   relatively early action to regulate air pollution emissions from oil and
   gas development, with Wyoming adopting its first sector-specific
   requirements in 1999. In contrast, New Mexico and Utah have been
   relatively slow to act. Furthermore, the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency did not adopt emissions standards for most oil and gas production
   activities until 2012, when it relied on Colorado and Wyoming as proving
   grounds for control technology. The regulatory history in these four
   western states shows that concern about ozone nonattainment was an
   important driver for control requirements in Colorado and Wyoming. These
   two states also have a history of relatively stringent pre-construction
   permitting requirements for small sources. In some areas, National
   Environmental Policy Act requirements for cumulative impact assessment
   drove adoption of tighter controls to mitigate impacts of growth. Moving
   forward, federal emissions standards will even out control requirements
   for new sources across the western states. However, control efforts that
   go beyond the 2012 federal standards will likely be needed in ozone
   nonattainment areas in western Wyoming, northeastern Utah, Colorado's
   Front Range, and in Indian Country. Further efforts will also be needed
   to address greenhouse gas emissions including methane.},

Title = {Cumulative effects on wetland landscapes: Links to wetland restoration

Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {775-788},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The cumulative effects of human actions on wetland ecosystems motivate
   current efforts at wetland restoration. They also have created in part
   the context within which restorations are undertaken. Using modern
   hydrogeological understanding of wetland-landscape linkages, I argue
   that restorations should begin with a cumulative impact analysis for the
   entire region in which the restoration is proposed. The analysis,
   however, should not focus merely on number of hectares of wetlands lost
   or degraded. It should be based on the concept of templates for wetland
   development. These templates are the diversity of settings created in
   specific landscapes by the complex interactions of hydrogeologic factors
   and climate. They control key hydrologic variables and hydrologically
   influenced chemical variables that cause specific wetland types to form
   and to be maintained through time. They also determine in large part the
   biogeochemical cycling characteristics specific to different types of
   wetlands. They thus account for both the biological and functional
   diversity of wetlands. A cumulative impact assessment for restoration
   purposes should identify the kinds, numbers, relative abundances, and
   spatial distribution of wetland templates in a region-both past and
   present. These past and present profiles of the wetland landscape can be
   used to make decisions regarding the type and location of restorations.
   Matching type and location to the appropriate hydrogeologic setting will
   maximize the probability of success for individual projects. Regional
   wetland diversity can be restored if individual restoration decisions
   about wetland type and location are made in light of the diversity of
   templates in past and present regional profiles.},

Abstract = {The cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on water systems are of
   rapidly growing concern within the field of environmental sciences and
   management, Most studies have focused on mixture toxicity and have dealt
   with responses of biota at either organismal or population level. Few
   studies have addressed responses of organisms exposed to combinations of
   chemical and physical stressors. Although antagonistic, additive and
   synergistic effects have been described for exposure of biota to
   combinations of chemical stressors, it seems to be agreed that
   concentration addition proves to be a reasonable worst case estimation.
   Therefore, aggregation of physico-chemical parameters in water quality
   indices and supplementary specifications of environmental quality
   objectives to account for mixture toxicity are generally based on
   concentration addition.
   In spite of a growing interest in multiple stressors, basic data are
   often lacking or inadequate to allow precise predictions of the
   cumulative impacts of multiple stressors at the ecosystem level. Even in
   the long term, investigation of all probable ecotoxicological responses
   to exposure to all possible combinations of stressors does not seem
   practically or economically feasible. Monitoring of a sophisticated
   combination of physico-chemical, and biological parameters improves
   detection and ecotoxicological risk assessment of multiple stressors.
   Application of quantitative structure-activity relationships, algorithms
   for mixture toxicity of known substances, (bio)chemical group parameters
   and response-oriented sum parameters may reduce uncertainties of
   cumulative impact assessment and can improve water quality management.},

Title = {Cumulative impacts across Australia's Great Barrier Reef: a mechanistic
   evaluation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cumulative impacts assessments on marine ecosystems have been hindered
   by the difficulty of collecting environmental data and identifying
   drivers of community dynamics beyond local scales. On coral reefs, an
   additional challenge is to disentangle the relative influence of
   multiple drivers that operate at different stages of coral ontogeny. We
   integrated coral life history, population dynamics, and spatially
   explicit environmental drivers to assess the relative and cumulative
   impacts of multiple stressors across 2,300 km of the world's largest
   coral reef ecosystem, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Using
   literature data, we characterized relationships between coral life
   history processes (reproduction, larval dispersal, recruitment, growth,
   and mortality) and environmental variables. We then simulated coral
   demographics and stressor impacts at the organism (coral colony) level
   on >3,800 individual reefs linked by larval connectivity and exposed to
   temporally and spatially realistic regimes of acute (crown-of-thorns
   starfish outbreaks, cyclones, and mass coral bleaching) and chronic
   (water-quality) stressors. Model simulations produced a credible
   reconstruction of recent (2008-2020) coral trajectories consistent with
   monitoring observations, while estimating the impacts of each stressor
   at reef and regional scales. Overall, simulated coral populations
   declined by one-third across the GBR, from an average of similar to 29\%
   to similar to 19\% hard coral cover. By 2020, <20\% of the GBR had coral
   cover higher than 30\%, a status of reef health corroborated by scarce
   and sparsely distributed monitoring data. Reef-wide annual rates of
   coral mortality were driven by bleaching (48\%) ahead of cyclones (41\%)
   and starfish predation (11\%). Beyond the reconstructed status and
   trends, the model enabled the emergence of complex interactions that
   compound the effects of multiple stressors while promoting a mechanistic
   understanding of coral cover dynamics. Drivers of coral cover growth
   were identified; notably, water quality (suspended sediments) was
   estimated to delay recovery for at least 25\% of inshore reefs.
   Standardized rates of coral loss and recovery allowed the integration of
   all cumulative impacts to determine the equilibrium cover for each reef.
   This metric, combined with maps of impacts, recovery potential,
   water-quality thresholds, and reef state metrics, facilitates strategic
   spatial planning and resilience-based management across the GBR.},

Abstract = {Social impact assessment (SIA) has traditionally been practiced as an
   ex-ante predictive tool in the context of regulatory approval by
   government agencies. This model of SIA developed by Burdge and others is
   based on `greenfields' development, of a new project going in to areas
   where there are no, or relatively few, similar types of development. The
   International Principles of SIA signalled a conceptual shift in the
   practice of SIA where greater emphasis is placed on the assessment and
   management of social issues across the life-cycle of developments. In
   addition forms of cumulative impact assessment have been developed for
   contexts where more than one project is likely to impact on populations
   or communities. With these changes to the traditional models of impact
   assessment there is a need to clarify how and when dedicated phases of
   `assessment' might be undertaken over the life-cycle of a development.
   In the context of the mining industry, SIAs are increasingly required by
   governments for incremental increases in the size or impact of these
   operations. This paper reviews the development and application of
   Project Expansion Assessments (PEAs) for two large-scale mining
   operations in Papua New Guinea. It argues that a different set of
   assumptions need to underlie the model of IA for such assessments, with
   more emphasis on trajectories rather than baselines, a critical
   evaluation and attribution of effects, and the incorporation of adaptive
   management tools into the process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Ecosystem restoration in Europe: Can analogies to Traditional Chinese
   Medicine facilitate the cross-policy harmonization on managing
   socioecological systems?},

Abstract = {Eli's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15\% restoration target.
   However, the understanding of restoration as a management tool remains
   ambiguous at EU and Member State levels.
   As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a well-defined priority
   setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The ``Methodological framework for
   assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in
   Bulgaria{''} proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and
   monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System (SES), to be embedded in the
   environmental policy framework.
   We extend the analogy between SES and the human body's system in the
   Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to inform restoration
   priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools at
   several levels:
   1. Overall objective: the sustainability goals correspond to the TCM's
   objective of a healthy, balanced body
   2, Restoration objectives and functioning: the desired ecosystem state
   can be better understood in analogy between the ecosystem structure and
   functioning framework for multiparametric optimization, and the TCM
   framework of Ying-Yang, Eight principles, Five elements and organs
   3. Ecosystem monitoring: Integrated monitoring may benefit from
   comparison to TCM diagnostics
   4. Ecosystem management approaches can benefit from the analogy to the
   TCM system of meridians
   We apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision making on
   restoration, streamlined ecosystem monitoring and a number of other
   issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas,
   defragmentation and connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.),
   are easier to understand, communicate, account for and manage. Ecosystem
   restoration is priority for China and the country has accumulated
   research and practical experience, including study of links between
   ecosystem management and the historical principles of Chinese
   philosophy.
   The Bulgarian and European approach to ecosystem based management can
   benefit from analogies to TCM. We derive policy recommendations by
   analogy, and illustrate them on the example of Natural Capital
   Accounting, (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {79-86},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC requires impact assessments called
   Appropriate Assessments (AA) for plans and projects probably having
   adverse effects on the sites of European ecological importance, Natura
   2000 sites. Seventy-three Appropriate Assessment reports and seventy
   official opinions given on them by regional environmental authorities
   from 1997 to 2005 were reviewed. The findings of the study demonstrate
   typical shortcomings of ecological impact assessment: a weak information
   basis for assessment outcomes and lack of proper cumulative impact
   assessment with respect to ecological structures and processes. The
   quality of reporting has improved over time with respect to direct
   impacts on individual habitat types and species and detailed mitigation
   measures. Regional environment centres considered one fifth of the AA
   reports to be inadequate because of lacking data. In most cases the
   regional environment centres demanded a change of plan or project, added
   mitigation measures, choice of only one alternative for further planning
   or a new completed assessment with additional information in order to be
   able to evaluate the significance of the effects. The study underlines
   the need for iterative planning practices in which the preparation of a
   plan or project with alternative options goes hand in hand with the
   impact assessment equipped with sufficient data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {The Evaluation of Cumulative Impacts in the Environmental Planning of
   Hydroelectric Plants in the Teles Pires River Basin in the Amazon Region},
Journal = {DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {22-47},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Amazon River basins concentrate a large part of the hydroelectric
   plants planned to meet the national electricity demands. The debate
   about the significant socio-environmental impacts associated with the
   advancement of hydroelectric frontiers in the Amazon region has been
   intense. Due to the socio-environmental vulnerability of the Amazon
   region to the hydroelectric dams, it is relevant to discuss the
   associated cumulative impacts. The planning of the hydropower sector
   uses two impact assessment tools: the Environmental Impact Study (EIS),
   for analyzing the environmental feasibility of hydroelectric dams, and
   the Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA), for analyzing impacts
   from a set of hydroelectric into watershed. The research focuses on
   ``Teles Pires{''} river basin where a series of hydropower projects has
   been planned. The objective was to analyze the assessment of cumulative
   impacts from the watershed to the hydroelectric through the impact
   assessment instruments. A research instrument has been used to
   synthesize guidelines for the evaluation of cumulative impacts in
   watershed and criteria was used to associate impacts in the watershed
   and in the individual hydropower projects. The main results reveal that:
   a) some of the good international practices for assessing cumulative
   impacts in watersheds are present in the environmental planning of
   hydroelectric dams; b) the analysis of cumulative impacts in the basin
   considers only the effects of hydroelectric projects; c) the cumulative
   impacts identified at the river basin level - in the IEA - were
   partially observed in the hydroelectric dams - in the EISs. The sector
   has the merit of integrating cumulative impacts assessment principles in
   taking decision in watersheds. However to guarantee the effectiveness of
   the instrument it is recommended to extend the scope of this analysis to
   other actions besides the hydroelectric ones. More value can be achieved
   by adopting procedures to carry out the EIS embedded in good practices
   for considering cumulative impacts at the level of hydroelectric
   projects.},

Abstract = {Due to the increasing food demand, the use of pesticides in agriculture
   is increasing. Particularly in low income countries poor training among
   farmers, combined with the use of obsolete pesticides may result in a
   high risk for the consumers. In this study six organochlorines and five
   organophosphates were analyzed in 54 samples of tomatoes from small
   scale farmers in Bolivia. The analyses were done on unprocessed, stored,
   washed and peeled tomatoes. The cumulated risk associated with
   consumption of the tomatoes after different storage times and processing
   treatments was evaluated using the Hazard Index (HI) for acute risk
   assessment. All 11 pesticides were detected in the analyses although
   several of them are obsolete and included in the Stockholm convention
   ratified by Bolivia. The organochlorines were found in the mu g
   pesticide/kg tomato range and below the HI, while the organophosphates
   were present in the mg pesticide/kg tomato range and most often above
   the HI. The low organochlorine concentrations were not significantly
   affected by time or treatment, but storage significantly decreased the
   concentrations of organophosphates. Washing decreased the initial
   concentrations to between 53\% (malathion) down to 2\% (ethyl
   parathion), while peeling had a larger effect reducing the initial
   concentrations to between 33\% (malathion) and 0.7\% (chlorpyriphos).
   Both the acute and chronic cumulative risk assessment of
   organophosphates showed a dietary risk for unprocessed tomatoes three
   days after harvest. For children, also the consumption of washed
   tomatoes constituted a dietary risk. To reduce the dietary risk of
   pesticide residues in Bolivia, there is an urgent need of farmer
   education and introduction of less hazardous pesticides as well as
   resources for surveillance and enforcement of legislation in order to
   ensure public health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Traditional land use systems are threatened by land use intensification
   and resulting land cover transitions in northern areas. This article
   examines cumulative land cover changes and their impacts on reindeer
   grazing grounds in the Kyro reindeer herding district in northern
   Finland. Land cover transitions were studied using Landsat TM and OLI
   images and topographic maps. The results showed that the herding
   district has experienced notable land cover changes during the past
   decades, and most of these changes were directly related to forestry.
   The proportion of continuous coniferous forests of the total forest
   cover declined from 92\% to 78\% between 1987 and 2013. Approximately
   one third of the forests outside current conservation areas were
   disturbed by forest management by 2013, and remaining forests were
   notably more fragmented than forests within conservation areas. The
   extent of the road and path networks expanded considerably between 1960s
   and 2010 as a result of increasing logging and tourism. Accumulation of
   disturbances gradually results in loss of key resources and declined
   quality of the landscape mosaic from the reindeer herding perspective,
   which can pose a serious threat to long-term sustainability of the
   livelihood. Rapid land cover changes in non-protected areas highlight an
   increasingly important role of conservation areas in maintaining
   resources for reindeer husbandry in the face of intensifying land use.
   Sustainable management of resources outside conservation areas requires
   careful participatory planning and efficient cumulative impact
   assessment of different land use activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Renewed interest in oil and natural gas in the Beaufort Sea has led to
   concerns about environmental effects resulting from the oil and gas
   activities. While environmental effects monitoring programs are being
   conducted by industry to meet regulatory requirements, and by government
   agencies in relation to cumulative impact assessment, nobody feels the
   importance of understanding the environmental changes resulting from oil
   and gas activities more than the people that live in coastal
   communities. With the settlement of land claims in Canada's arctic, a
   co-management approach to resource allocation and use, research, and
   monitoring has been established. This new form of governance in the
   arctic is dependent on a high level of community involvement and
   consultation. The Tariuq (Ocean) community-based monitoring program was
   piloted in Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik in 2001 as one of the initiatives
   under the Beaufort Sea Integrated Management Planning Initiative. It is
   consistent with the principles outlined in Canada's Oceans Act and
   Canada's Oceans Strategy. The program engages coastal communities in
   monitoring the health of the Beaufort Sea through their participation in
   the selection of indicators, conducting of monitoring activities, review
   of monitoring results, and finally the dissemination of the findings
   back to the community. Tariuq concurrently, builds capacity within the
   communities and presents an opportunity to engage and train youth in
   scientific sampling methods. Community-based monitoring provides the
   benefits of incorporating traditional knowledge and scientific
   methodology into a monitoring program. It can also provide a broader
   spatial and temporal coverage than industry and government monitoring
   programs.},

Title = {Effects of small hydropower dams on macroinvertebrate and fish

Abstract = {Hydropower dams affect freshwater biodiversity by virtue of modifying
   flow regimes and degrading habitat conditions both above and below the
   water impoundment and diversion structure. In recent decades, there has
   been a global proliferation of Small Hydropower Plants (SHPs) propelled
   by incentive policies and a general perception that small dams are less
   harmful to the environment. However, limited science is available on the
   effects of SHPs on freshwater biodiversity, which is concerning
   considering their sheer numbers and the high variability in the size and
   operation of dams classified as SHPs. We investigated the ecological
   effects of 12 SHPs on macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages of the
   Chapeco River Basin, Brazil. Our study included sites located upstream
   of the SHPs and sites directly affected by their operations (i.e.,
   reservoir, dewatering section and downstream of the powerhouse). This
   design allowed us to quantify shifts in taxonomic composition and
   examine the relative role of different SHP attributes (e.g., dam height,
   reservoir area, age) in explaining these changes. Our results reveal
   that SHPs modify the composition of both macroinvertebrate and fish
   assemblages, but the magnitude of such changes vary widely among dams.
   Both assemblages exhibited directionality in taxonomic shifts, resulting
   in a gradual replacement of taxa associated with fast-flowing habitats
   by other groups more commonly associated with standing waters. We also
   found that changes in assemblage structureare related to structural (dam
   height, reservoir area) and spatial attributes (distance from
   headwaters) of SHPs, although the predictive power of these attributes
   varied taxonomically and among reservoir, dewatering and downstream
   sites. Overall, our results demonstrate that SHPs have important and
   heterogeneous effects on freshwater assemblages, which may manifest
   individually or cumulatively across the riverscape. This suggests that
   it is unlikely that a priori classifications of dams based on their
   structural attributes can replace site-specific and cumulative impact
   assessments. The results also shed light on the need for better
   understanding of how SHP attributes shape their ecological effects, so
   that a full assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the
   wide range of ``small{''} dams is possible.},

Title = {Australian advances in vegetation classification and the need for a

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Number = {7},
Pages = {329-338},
Abstract = {This editorial introduces the Australian Journal of Botany special issue
   `Vegetation science for decision-making'. Vegetation science and
   classification are crucial to understanding Australian landscapes. From
   the mulga shrublands of the arid interior to the monsoon rain forests of
   northern Australia, we have culturally and scientifically built upon the
   delineation of vegetation into recognisable and repeatable patterns. As
   remote sensing and database capacities increase, this improved
   capability to measure vegetation and share data also prompts
   collaboration and synthesis of complex, specialised datasets. Although
   the task faces significant challenges, the growing body of literature
   demonstrates a strong discipline. In Australia, purpose-driven products
   describe vegetation at broad scales (e.g. the National Vegetation
   Information System, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network). At fine
   scales however (i.e. that of the vegetation community), no uniform
   framework or agreed protocols exist. Climate and landform dictate
   vegetation patterns at broad scales, but microtopography, microclimate
   and biotic processes act as filters at finer scales. This is the scale
   where climate-change impacts are most likely to be detected and
   effected; this is the scale at which a deeper understanding of
   evolutionary ecology will be achieved, and it is the scale at which
   species need to be protected. A common language and system for
   understanding Australian communities and impetus for collecting data at
   this scale is needed. In the face of ongoing climate and development
   pressures and an increasingly complex set of tools to manage these
   threats (e.g. offset policies, cumulative impact assessments), a
   nationally collaborative approach is needed. It is our hope that this
   special issue will help to achieve this.},

Title = {Phthalates in German daycare centers: Occurrence in air and dust and the
   excretion of their metabolites by children (LUPE 3)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {64-72},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Phthalates have been used for decades in large quantities, leading to
   the ubiquitous exposure of the population. In an investigation of 63
   German daycare centers, indoor air and dust samples were analyzed for
   the presence of 10 phthalate diesters. Moreover, 10 primary and
   secondary phthalate metabolites were quantified in urine samples from
   663 children attending these facilities. In addition, the urine
   specimens of 150 children were collected after the weekend and before
   they went to daycare centers.
   Di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate (DnBP), and
   di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were found in the indoor air, with
   median values of 468, 227, and 194 ng/m(3), respectively. In the dust,
   median values of 888 mg/kg for DEHP and 302 mg/kg for di-isononyl
   phthalate (DiNP) were observed. DnBP and DiBP were together responsible
   for 55\% of the total phthalate concentration in the indoor air, whereas
   DEHP and DiNP were responsible for 70\% and 24\% of the total phthalate
   concentration in the dust.
   Median concentrations in the urine specimens were 44.7 mu g/l for the
   DiBP monoester, 32.4 mu g/l for the DnBP monoester, and 16.5 mu g/l and
   17.9 mu g/l for the two secondary DEHP metabolites. For some phthalates,
   we observed significant correlations between their concentrations in the
   indoor air and dust and their corresponding metabolites in the urine
   specimens using bivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, the
   concentrations in dust were not associated with urinary metabolite
   excretion after controlling for the concentrations in the indoor air.
   The total daily ``high{''} intake levels based on the 95th percentiles
   calculated from the biomonitoring data were 14.1 mu g/kg b.w. for DiNP
   and 11.9 mu g/kg b.w. for DEHP. Compared with tolerable daily intake
   (TDI) values, our ``high{''} intake was 62\% of the TDI value for DiBP,
   49\% for DnBP, 24\% for DEHP, and 9\% for DiNP. For DiBP, the total
   daily intake exceeded the TDI value for 2.4\% of the individuals. Using
   a cumulative risk-assessment approach for the sum of DEHP, DnBP, and
   DiBP, 20\% of the children had concentrations exceeding the hazard index
   of one. Therefore, a further reduction of the phthalate exposure of
   children is needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Insights into the spatiotemporal occurrence and mixture risk assessment

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Household and personal care products (HPCPs) are a kind of contaminants
   closely related to daily life, capturing worldwide concern. To our
   knowledge, this is the first attempt focusing on the spatiotemporal
   occurrence and mixture risk of HPCPs in the waters from rivers to
   Laizhou Bay. Nine HPCPs were quantitated in 216 water samples gathered
   from Laizhou Bay and its adjacent rivers in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to
   reveal the spatiotemporal occurrence and mixture ecological risks in
   Laizhou Bay. Eight HPCPs were detected with detection frequencies
   ranging from 74\% to 100\%. The total concentrations were in the ranges
   105-721 ng L-1 in river water and 51.3-332 ng L-1 in seawater. The HPCPs
   were dominated by p-hydroxybenznic and triclosan, which together
   contributed over 75\% of the total HPCPs. The average level of the total
   HPCP concentration in the summer of 2018 (96.1 ng L-1) was slightly
   exceed that in the spring of 2019 (91.6 ng L-1), which is associated
   with the higher usage of HPCPs and enhanced tourism during summer.
   However, the highest total concentrations were found in spring of 2021
   (124 ng L-1 in average), which was attribute to a higher level of
   methylparaben, a predominant paraben used as preservatives in commercial
   pharmaceuticals of China. Influenced by riverine inputs and ocean
   currents, higher HPCP concentrations in Laizhou Bay were found nearby
   the estuary of Yellow River and the southern part of the bay. Triclosan
   should be given constant concern considering its medium to high risks
   (RQ > 0.1) in nearly 80\% of the water samples. The cumulative risk
   assessment in two approaches revealed that HPCP mixtures generally
   elicit medium or high risk to three main aquatic taxa. Considering the
   worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, the levels and risks of multiple HPCPs
   in natural waters requires constant attention in future studies.},

Title = {A comprehensive threat analysis to support the red list of marine and

Abstract = {IntroductionHuman activities represent a growing threat to biodiversity,
   increasing species extinction and leading ecosystems to collapse. The
   knowledge of the spatial distribution of threats to ecosystems is
   fundamental to understanding their risk of collapse as defined by the
   Red List of Ecosystems, an International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN) global standard to guide conservation and management
   actions. Colombia is a megadiverse country; almost half of its territory
   is marine, and its ecosystems are subject to anthropogenic and climatic
   threats. MethodologyThis study provides a quantitative map assessment
   for a set of relevant anthropic and climatic threats and impacts on the
   marine and coastal areas of Colombia, intending to perform the threat
   description component of the Red List assessment protocol. A cumulative
   impact assessment was applied to analyze the threat levels (TLs) and
   impact levels of 12 anthropogenic and climatic pressures. ResultsThe
   observed TL patterns meet spatial expectations, revealing that the
   assessment units in the Caribbean Sea are more threatened than those in
   the Pacific Ocean, and continental areas are more threatened than the
   oceanic ones. Habitat transformation and sea warming were the threats
   with the most impact on coastal and marine ecosystems, respectively.
   Climatic threats were widely extended throughout the study area,
   occurring even in the most pristine zones (e.g., Malpelo Island).
   DiscussionClimate threats are challenging to national conservation
   strategies since these pressures are not completely manageable at local
   scales as they depend mainly on global efforts. Recommendations drawn
   from this work can guide actions for the conservation of the ecosystems
   of Colombia.},

   Implications for Brazilian Coral Reefs},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Effective management of coral reefs requires strategies tailored to cope
   with cumulative disturbances from human activities. In Brazil, where
   coral reefs are a priority for conservation, intensifying threats from
   local and global stressors are of paramount concern to management
   agencies. Using a cumulative impact assessment approach, our goal was to
   inform management actions for coral reefs in Brazil by assessing their
   exposure to multiple stressors (fishing, land-based activities, coastal
   development, mining, aquaculture, shipping, and global warming). We
   calculated an index of the risk to cumulative impacts: (i) assuming
   uniform sensitivity of coral reefs to stressors; and (ii) using impact
   weights to reflect varying tolerance levels of coral reefs to each
   stressor. We also predicted the index in both the presence and absence
   of global warming. We found that 16\% and 37\% of coral reefs had high
   to very high risk of cumulative impacts, without and with information on
   sensitivity respectively, and 42\% of reefs had low risk to cumulative
   impacts from both local and global stressors. Our outputs are the first
   comprehensive spatial dataset of cumulative impact on coral reefs in
   Brazil, and show that areas requiring attention mostly corresponded to
   those closer to population centres. We demonstrate how the relationships
   between risks from local and global stressors can be used to derive
   strategic management actions.},

Title = {Abundance and Trends of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises (<i>Neophocaena
   phocaenoides</i>) in Hong Kong Waters, 1996-2019},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {The Indo-Pacific finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) occurs
   year-round in waters of southern and eastern Hong Kong. The population
   biology of the population was studied in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
   but has not been examined recently. There are several threats facing the
   animals, and there has been recent concern about this species' status,
   due to an increase in the number of strandings in Hong Kong.
   Linetransect surveys using medium-size vessels have been conducted for
   small cetaceans in most of Hong Kong's waters since 1996. We examined
   the density and abundance of finless porpoises in this area, using a
   Bayesian hierarchical framework, consisting of a Markov process model
   used to describe population dynamics and a distance-sampling observation
   model that links the line-transect data to the latent biological
   process. Time-series analyses for both dry- and wet-season data from
   1996 to 2019 showed annual fluctuations in abundance indices, but no
   evidence of a significant long-term trend in finless porpoise abundance
   in Hong Kong. This indicates that the increase in strandings may be
   related to some factor other than changing population size of Hong Kong
   finless porpoises. In 2019, there were approximately 176 finless
   porpoises in Hong Kong's waters in the dry season (winter/spring), the
   season of highest use. Highest densities (0.535 porpoises/km(2)) were
   recorded in South Lantau in the dry season. Based on the results of the
   current study, we recommend further survey work, improvements in data
   collection, possible tagging and molecular work to elucidate population
   structure, cumulative impact assessment, and the establishment of
   several marine parks for the conservation of finless porpoises in Hong
   Kong.},

Title = {Advancing Global Ecological Modeling Capabilities to Simulate Future
   Trajectories of Change in Marine Ecosystems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Considerable effort is being deployed to predict the impacts of climate
   change and anthropogenic activities on the ocean's biophysical
   environment, biodiversity, and natural resources to better understand
   how marine ecosystems and provided services to humans are likely to
   change and explore alternative pathways and options. We present an
   updated version of EcoOcean (v2), a spatial-temporal ecosystem modeling
   complex of the global ocean that spans food-web dynamics from primary
   producers to top predators. Advancements include an enhanced ability to
   reproduce spatial-temporal ecosystem dynamics by linking species
   productivity, distributions, and trophic interactions to the impacts of
   climate change and worldwide fisheries. The updated modeling platform is
   used to simulate past and future scenarios of change, where we quantify
   the impacts of alternative configurations of the ecological model,
   responses to climate-change scenarios, and the additional impacts of
   fishing. Climate-change scenarios are obtained from two Earth-System
   Models (ESMs, GFDL-ESM2M, and IPSL-CMA5-LR) and two contrasting emission
   pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5) for historical (1950-2005) and future
   (2006-2100) periods. Standardized ecological indicators and biomasses of
   selected species groups are used to compare simulations. Results show
   how future ecological trajectories are sensitive to alternative
   configurations of EcoOcean, and yield moderate differences when looking
   at ecological indicators and larger differences for biomasses of species
   groups. Ecological trajectories are also sensitive to environmental
   drivers from alternative ESM outputs and RCPs, and show spatial
   variability and more severe changes when IPSL and RCP 8.5 are used.
   Under a non-fishing configuration, larger organisms show decreasing
   trends, while smaller organisms show mixed or increasing results.
   Fishing intensifies the negative effects predicted by climate change,
   again stronger under IPSL and RCP 8.5, which results in stronger biomass
   declines for species already losing under climate change, or dampened
   positive impacts for those increasing. Several species groups that win
   under climate change become losers under combined impacts, while only a
   few (small benthopelagic fish and cephalopods) species are projected to
   show positive biomass changes under cumulative impacts. EcoOcean v2 can
   contribute to the quantification of cumulative impact assessments of
   multiple stressors and of plausible ocean-based solutions to prevent,
   mitigate and adapt to global change.},

Title = {A modelling approach to inform regional cumulative effects assessment in
   northern Ontario},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Cumulatively, the effects of resource extraction and climate change have
   the potential to cause an unprecedented change to the ecosystems and
   livelihoods of Indigenous communities in Canada's northern regions.
   Maintaining environmental and community values in the presence of such
   change will require a comprehensive understanding of potential long-term
   risks and opportunities to prevent or mitigate risks at the regional
   level. However, assessing the cumulative impact and benefits of the
   multiple disturbances at the regional level is complex due to the
   interaction of numerous drivers, values, actors, assessment scales,
   planning, and decision-making processes. We develop an integrated risk
   and cumulative effects (CE) management methodology to inform regional
   assessment by combining conceptual modelling through bowtie analysis and
   quantitative scenario analysis using ALCES Online (AO) simulation. We
   applied the framework using a case example in the Ring of Fire region of
   northern Ontario, Canada, to assess the CE of climate change, land use
   change, and wildlife harvest on the moose (Alces alces)-wolf (Canis
   lupus)-caribou (Rangifer tarandus) prey-predator system. The bowtie risk
   analysis provided a mechanism to define the management problem by
   identifying threats that contribute to risk, associated consequences,
   and specific management strategies that could be pursued under
   legislative frameworks and changes to maintain the sustainable dynamics
   of the moose-wolf-caribou system (MWC). The AO simulation of different
   levels of development and moose harvest, as well a baseline scenario
   that excluded climate change and development, allowed for a
   comprehensive examination of the complex processes driving the
   social-ecological system. The scenario analysis suggests that moose
   harvest can promote balance in the MWC system but only if applied in a
   sophisticated manner that limits moose harvest in areas with high road
   density, increases moose harvest in more remote regions susceptible to
   moose population expansion with climate change, and prioritizes
   Indigenous moose harvest to ensure a sustainable supply of moose for
   subsistence harvest. The case example shows how conceptual and
   quantitative modelling can provide the strategic perspective required
   for regional assessment.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment of phthalates exposure for recurrent
   pregnancy loss in reproductive-aged women population using multiple
   hazard indices approaches},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Phthalates, which are commonly used in flexible plastics and consumer
   products, have been reported to be toxic to reproductive and
   developmental function in mammals. Past studies have focused on the
   toxic effects on male reproduction, with only a few studies conducted on
   the risks that cumulative exposure to phthalates have on the female
   reproductive system. We recruited 260 patients with recurrent pregnancy
   loss (RPL) of unknown etiology and 203 controls from the clinics of
   Obstetrics and Gynecology at a medical center in southern Taiwan from
   2013 to 2020. The daily intake of phthalates was estimated from urine
   samples using the back-calculation method, after which the cumulative
   risk was determined using multiple hazard indices, including a
   dose-addition model, a receptor effect model, and a hazard index
   approach. The patients with RPL had a significantly higher cumulative
   exposure to phthalates (p < 0.05) than did the controls with a hazard
   index above one. After adjusted logistic regression analysis, we found
   that the risk of RPL was strongly related to the higher quartiles of
   DEHP, the DEHPTEQ for the antiandrogenic effect and adverse effects of
   the female reproductive system and the ER alpha binding effect (p <
   0.05). Our work suggests that more attentions should be paid to the
   adverse effects induced by phthalates on female reproduction, especially
   the effects caused by the cumulative exposure to phthalates in women of
   reproductive age.},

Title = {Environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy
   Act and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-23},

Abstract = {Antarctica has been set aside by the international community for
   protection as a natural reserve and a place for scientific research.
   Through the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, the signing nations ag reed to
   cooperate in protecting the antarctic environment, in conducting
   scientific studies, and in abstaining from the exercise of territorial
   claims. The 1991 signing of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to
   the Antarctic Treaty (Protocol) by representatives of the 26 nations
   comprising the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (Parties)
   significantly strengthened environmental protection measures for the
   continent. The Protocol required ratification by each of the governments
   individually prior to official implementation. The US government
   ratified the Protocol by passage of the Antarctic Science, Tourism, and
   Conservation Act of 1997. Japan completed the process by ratifying the
   Protocol on December 15, 1997.
   US government actions undertaken in Antarctica are subject to the
   requirements of both the Protocol and the US National Environmental
   Policy Act (NEPA). There are differences in the scope and intent of the
   Protocol and NEPA; however, both require environmental impact assessment
   (EIA) as part of the planning process for proposed actions that have the
   potential for environmental impacts. In this paper we describe the two
   instruments and highlight key similarities and differences with
   particular attention to EIA. Through this comparison of the EIA
   requirements of NEPA and the Protocol, we show how the requirements of
   each can be used in concert to provide enhanced environmental protection
   for the antarctic environment. NEPA applies only to actions of the US
   government; therefore, because NEPA includes certain desirable
   attributes that have been refined and clarified through numerous court
   cases, and because the Protocol is just entering implementation
   internationally some recommendations are made for strengthening the
   procedural requirements of the Protocol for activities undertaken by all
   Parties in Antarctica.
   The Protocol gives clear and strong guidance for protection of specific,
   Valued antarctic environmental resources including intrinsic wilderness
   and aesthetic values, and the value of Antarctica as an area for
   scientific research. That guidance requires a higher standard of
   environmental protection for Antarctica than is required in other parts
   of the world. This paper shows that taken together NEPA and the Protocol
   call for closer examination of proposed actions and a more rigorous
   consideration of environmental impacts than either would alone. Three
   areas are identified where the EIA provisions of the Protocol could be
   strengthened to improve its effectiveness. First, the thresholds defined
   by the Protocol need to be clarified. Specifically, the meanings of the
   terms ``minor{''} and ``transitory{''} are not clear in the context of
   the Protocol. The use of ``or{''} in the phrase ``minor or
   transitory{''} further confuses the meaning. Second, cumulative impact
   assessment is called for by the Protocol but is not defined. A clear
   definition could reduce the chance that cumulative impacts would be
   given inadequate consideration. Finally, the public has limited
   opportunities to comment on or influence the preparation of initial or
   comprehensive environmental evaluations. Experience has shown that
   public input to environmental documents has a considerable influence on
   agency decision making and the quality of EIA that agencies perform.},

Title = {POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF INTEGRATED OIL AND GAS PLANT ON AMBIENT AIR QUALITY},
Journal = {ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {331-344},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The ISCST-3 model has been used to study the ground level concentrations
   of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO(X)), particulate matter
   less than 10.0 microns in diameter (PM(10)) and sulphur dioxide (SO(2)).
   The purpose was to predict air quality effects from an integrated oil
   and gas project (IOGP) proposed for the Niger Delta, Nigeria. The
   emissions of 12 elevated point sources for criteria air pollutants were
   considered with eight different scenarios. Both natural gas-fired and
   diesel (AGO) fired equipment were considered for the identified emission
   sources. Five years of hourly meteorological observations were used in
   the prediction of the ground level concentration of the pollutants.
   The model outputs show a general maximum ground level concentration
   between 0.5 - 3.5 km, with easterly and north-easterly receptors having
   the greatest concentration. The pollutants emitted in the greatest
   concentration in their order of magnitude were CO, NO(x) and PM(10).
   Maximum ground level concentration for 1, 8 and 24 - hr periods for CO
   were below regulatory standards (less than 10 \%) for scenarios 1 - 4
   when the fuel is natural gas. The 8 - hr ground level concentrations
   were about 1.3 folds of the World Bank Standard in scenarios 5 - 8 when
   the fuel sources are switched to AGO. However in these scenarios, the
   Nigerian environment and petroleum ministries' emission limits were not
   breached for all the averaging periods. Modelled NO(X) concentrations
   were significant in all the scenarios except 3 and 4. Though NO(X)
   concentrations were within the standards for all the averaging periods
   in scenarios 1 - 4, except the 1 - hr limit that was breached in
   scenarios 1 and 2, these concentrations were about 1.1 - 2.8 folds in
   all the averaging periods of all the standards in scenarios 5 - 8. The
   predicted PM(10) and SO(2) concentrations are all below the guideline
   limits. If the use of AGO is completely avoided in the entire life of
   the proposed IOGP, the air quality of its immediate vicinity can be
   protected. Furthermore, the declaration of a radius 1.75 km natural
   forest buffer around the plant and continuous monitoring of ground level
   concentrations of CO, NO(X), PM(10), and SO(2) may further assist in
   guaranteeing the safety of people in terms of air quality. The study
   shows the need for policy formulation that will integrate comprehensive
   cumulative impacts assessment of air quality in the environmental laws
   regulating the gas development projects in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Until recently, environmental assessments were conducted without regard
   to either upstream or downstream developments, such that the relative
   contributions of individual developments could not be separated. The
   environmental legislative agenda in Canada has been proceeding at a pace
   where there is an expectation to address the cumulative effects of
   existing developments prior to the development of methodology for
   conducting these assessments. We initiated a long-term study in 1991
   which is attempting to address the cumulative aquatic effects of
   hydroelectric facilities and pulp mill discharges on fish populations
   within the Moose River basin in Northern Ontario. The focus is placed on
   the top-down interpretation of the impact of alterations in habitat and
   fish energetics associated with damage at the fish population level and
   not on detailed initial characterization of stressors. This approach
   allows follow-up studies to focus on the critical areas associated with
   responses of surviving fish within the watersheds in an attempt to
   identify limiting environmental conditions and the responsible
   stressors. The objectives of the project are to provide an
   interpretation framework using traditional fisheries information to
   assess the integrated effects of all stressors on the populations at
   risk and to isolate key areas and critical stages in life history
   associated with those changes in fish populations.},

Abstract = {Phthalates are widely used in consumer products. People are frequently
   exposed to phthalates due to their applications in daily life. In this
   study, 14 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in 108 urine samples
   collected from Chinese young adults using high-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The total concentrations of 14
   phthalate metabolites ranged from 71.3 to 2670 ng/mL, with the geometric
   mean concentration of 306 ng/mL. mBP and miBP were the two most abundant
   compounds, accounting for 48\% of the total concentrations. Principal
   component analysis suggested two major sources of phthalates: one
   dominated by the DEHP metabolites and one by the group of mCPP, mBP and
   miBP metabolites. The estimated daily intakes of DMP, DEP, DBP, DiBP and
   DEHP were 1.68, 2.14, 4.12, 3.52 and 1.26-2.98 mu g/kg-bw/day,
   respectively. In a sensitivity analysis, urinary concentration and body
   weight were the most influential variables for human exposure
   estimation. Furthermore, cumulative risk for hazard quotient (HQ) and
   hazard index (HI) were evaluated. Nearly half of Chinese young adults
   had high HI values exceeding the safe threshold. This is the first study
   on the occurrence and human exposure to urinary phthalate metabolites
   with Chinese young adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cumulative risk assessment and exposure characteristics of parabens in

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Parabens, a group of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are well
   known preservatives in pharmaceuticals and personal care products
   (PPCPs). However, studies on parabens exposure and their cumulative
   effects in Asian population are limited. This study aimed to identify
   the exposure characteristics and estimate the cumulative risk of four
   parabens in the general Taiwanese. We have collected urine samples
   including 271 adults (18-97 yrs old) and 95 minors (7-17 yrs old), from
   Taiwan Environmental Survey for Toxicants 2013, and analyzed for four
   urinary parabens including methyl (MeP)-, ethyl (EtP)-, propyl (PrP)-,
   and butylparaben (BuP) by using ultraperformance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The health-based guidance value
   (HBGV) and the antiandrogenic properties of parabens were used to
   calculate the hazard index (HI) for cumulative risk. MeP and PrP were
   most abundant compounds and startlingly higher than those in other
   countries. Adults had a higher geometric mean level of four parabens
   than minors (adults: MeP, 381.7; PrP, 108.6; EtP, 39.6 and BuP 6.3
   ng/mL; minors: MeP, 65.7; PrP, 7.9, EtP, 2.6 and BuP 2.2 ng/mL).
   Participants who used a higher number of personal care products had a
   significantly higher risk with higher concentrations of PrP (above 75th
   \%tile) {[}adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.79, 95 \% CI: 1.01-3.15] and BuP
   {[}aOR: 1.78, 95 \% CI: 1.03-3.07]. The median and 95th \%tile HI (the
   sum of the HQs of each paraben) was as 1.10 and 4.39-fold higher than
   acceptable cumulative threshold (HI <1) and PrP accounted for 90 \% of
   the HI. Our results indicate omnipresent exposure to parabens among the
   Taiwanese population, which},

Abstract = {Large scale coastal land-claim and sea-enclosing (CLASE) activities have
   caused habitat destruction, biodiversity losses and water deterioration,
   thus the local governments in China have recently undertaken seabed
   dredging and dyke opening (SDADO) as typical ecological restoration
   projects. However, some projects focus on a single impact on
   hydrodynamic conditions, water quality or marine organisms. In a case
   study in Xiamen, China, an integrated effects assessment framework
   centres on ecohydrology, using modeling of hydrodynamic conditions and
   statistical analysis of water quality, was developed to assess the
   effects of ecological restoration projects. The benefits of SDADO
   projects include improving hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, as
   a precursor to further marine biological improvements. This study
   highlights the need to comprehensively consider ecological effects of
   SDADO projects in the planning stage, and an integrative assessment
   method combining cumulative effects of hydrodynamic conditions, water
   quality and biological factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE ISSUES IN THE WESTERN INDIAN-OCEAN REGION},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {401-419},
Abstract = {Mounting evidence from both instrumental and proxy records shows global
   climate continues to change. Analysis of near-surface temperatures over
   land and oceans during the past 130 years shows marked warming during
   the first half of this century with relatively steady temperatures
   through the mid-1970s followed by a rapid warming during the 1980s. The
   source of this warming is unclear at present. The warmest decade in the
   recent record is the 1980s with some of the most pronounced warming
   occurring in the lower latitudes, including the Western Indian Ocean. In
   the context of this study, the important consequences of climate warming
   are: (1) the potential impacts associated with rising sea level due to
   thermal expansion of the oceans; (2) melting of land-based ice sheets
   and glaciers; (3) the increased frequency, intensity, and seasonality of
   tropical storms and the monsoon season; and (4) changes in local
   land-use practices. Rising sea level, coupled with meteorological
   changes, creates a potential for increased coastal erosion and loss of
   coastal habitats such as wetlands, mangroves, and coral reef
   communities. These potential impacts may affect future land-use and
   development practices. For example, the curtailment of tourism could
   after economic growth and development. Forecasting the potential
   regional and local impacts of global warming is not a trivial problem.
   General circulation models presently do not provide the necessary
   fine-scale resolution required for ascertaining such smaller-scale
   effects. In addition, there is little agreement between the forecasts
   from different models of past, present, or future patterns on such
   fundamental climate variables as precipitation and air temperature. The
   absence of quality regional and local tide-gauge data of the appropriate
   duration necessary for calculating changes in the relative sea level
   exacerbates the existing theoretical uncertainty. Nevertheless, the
   potential impacts do represent present-day problems resulting from the
   alteration and acceleration of naturally occurring processes through
   man's activities. These types of future problems which typify the
   impacts forecast as a result of global warming are occurring now, partly
   because of human activities. Such insular impacts in the Western Indian
   Ocean region should be used by local governments as case studies for
   educating the populace, developing remedial activities, analyzing
   socioeconomic patterns, and formulating long-term management and policy
   strategies that will minimize unwanted future changes. Finally, a
   regional strategy is needed to address the following issues: (1) the
   acquisition and interpretation of tide-gauge and other geodetic data to
   provide estimates of the local and regional relative sea-level rise; (2)
   a plan to identify and suggest possible mitigation for regional and
   local activities (land use, economic development practices, industrial
   development etc.) that may directly contribute to enhanced global
   warming through the release of carbon dioxide and other radiatively
   active gases; (3) the development of regional and local policies (e.g.
   land use, coastal zoning, building setbacks, etc.) to minimize the
   impacts resulting from extant and possible future relative sea-level
   rise and meteorological changes; and (4) the linkages between potential
   changes in global (regional) climate and present anthropogenic stress
   upon the environment-that is, cumulative impact assessment. The
   challenge is to recognize the need for regional and local action in the
   absence of site-specific data, or scientific certainty.},

Abstract = {Both environmental indicators and multi-metric indices are useful for
   describing baseline conditions and qualitatively predicting the
   cumulative consequences of multiple actions. Several examples and case
   studies associated with indicators and/or indices are presented herein.
   They can be easily modified for usage in CEAM. Habitat suitability
   models reflect special indices related to habitat needs and quality for
   specific species or broad habitat types. Such models have been used to
   address direct and indirect effects, and with some modification, they
   can be also used to address cumulative effects of multiple actions. This
   review has indicated that there are numerous examples of such tools
   which have been or could be used in both EIA and CEAM. Some key lessons
   are: (1) in conducting CEAM studies, it is useful to think from the
   mindset that ``I am the VEC or indicator, and what is my historical and
   current condition and how have I, or will I, be affected by multiple
   past, present, and future actions?{''}: (2) due to the likely absence of
   detailed information on future actions, the described tools can still be
   used to ``predict{''} future conditions by focusing on qualitative
   up-or-down changes in individual indicators or indices with their
   aggregated displays: and (3) numerous regional and site-specific tools
   are currently available, with one example being indices of biological
   integrity for specific watersheds and water bodies. Such tools, even
   though they may not have been developed for CEAM usage, can certainly
   benefit CEAM studies and practice. Finally, usage of selected and
   appropriate tools as described herein can aid in conducting
   science-based, systematic, and documentable CEAM studies. (C) 2011

Title = {Lasting regional gains from non-renewable resource extraction: The role
   of sustainability-based cumulative effects assessment and regional
   planning for mining development in Canada},
Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {If mining proposals are to receive more positive reception in host
   communities and regions, they will need to be planned, reviewed and
   approved in ways that ensure they contribute to more sustainable
   regional futures. That transition will require improvements in
   individual project assessment practice-especially a shift from a focus
   on mitigating ``significant adverse effects{''} to requiring ``positive
   contributions to sustainability{''} as well as avoidance of adverse
   effects. It will also demand more effective regional planning and other
   strategic level efforts to provide attention to the cumulative regional
   effects of multiple mining projects, associated infrastructure and other
   past, current and anticipated activities. Such broader work would
   provide a better examined context and more authoritative guidance for
   individual project planning and development. Regional scale planning and
   assessment are largely a responsibility of governments, not something
   that individual mine proponents can reasonably be expected to deliver
   adequately in project-based assessment and approval processes. This
   paper reviews the current status of assessment regimes, identifies
   deficiencies and suggests where best practice opportunities exist. The
   implications are summarized as recommendations for assessment regime
   design that addresses cumulative effects, largely through regional
   processes linked to project-level assessments, and that incorporate the
   following five characteristics:
   (i) Multi-dimensional: covers the full suite of cumulative effects of
   multiple undertakings, past, present and reasonably foreseeable in the
   relevant regional future (well beyond the individual project level), in
   light of contribution to sustainability objectives;
   (ii) Long term: uses scenarios or some equivalent to explore and
   illuminate the nature and potential implications of plausible and
   desirable futures, to identify alternative pathways and plan options to
   examine;
   (iii) Credible: establishes explicit open processes for elaborating and
   evaluating regional alternatives and justifying decisions in light of
   context-specified sustainability-based criteria and trade-off rules;
   (iv) Authoritative: integrates regional assessment conclusions as
   decisions in legislatively authoritative regional plans or the
   equivalent with provisions for ensuring compliance in project level
   planning and assessment; and
   (v) Accountable: ensures clear and accountable assignment of cumulative
   effects management responsibilities and expectations, including
   provisions for engaged monitoring, effective responses and public
   reporting.
   Special attention to legacy effects is also emphasized because orebodies
   are non-renewable resources. For illustrative purposes, the paper
   considers approaches to anticipated mining development in the Ring of
   Fire region, 500 km of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, where reliance on
   individual project assessments is problematic given the regional
   cumulative effects issues and the range of alternative response options.

Abstract = {Development pressures have grown dramatically in the Northwest
   Territories (NWT) over the past decade and are likely to continue to
   increase over the coming years. Proper assessment and management of the
   cumulative effects of these developments poses significant challenges
   and, if done properly, offer real opportunities for responsible economic
   development within a sound environmental management framework. While no
   one agency has sole responsible for assessing and managing cumulative
   effects, it is clear that no agency is without responsibility. For this
   reason, a partnership of representatives from aboriginal, territorial,
   and federal governments; environmental nongovernment organizations; the
   Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board; and the mining and
   oil and gas sectors developed an innovative framework for the NWT to
   address these challenges. The components of the integrated framework
   include an overall vision and objectives, land use planning, baseline
   studies and monitoring, research, audit and reporting, project-specific
   screening, environmental assessment and review, regulation and
   enforcement, information management, coordination, and capacity
   building. Implementation of the framework will better enable decision
   makers to make the wise decisions necessary to protect the natural and
   social environment of the NWT and, at the same time, promote responsible
   development.},

Title = {Cumulative impact assessments of multiple host species loss from plant
   diseases show disproportionate reductions in associated biodiversity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Volume = {110},

Pages = {221-231},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Non-native plant pests and pathogens are increasing exponentially,
   causing extirpation of foundation species. The impact of large-scale
   declines in a single host on associated biodiversity is widely
   documented. However, the impact of multiple host loss on biodiversity
   and whether these impacts are multiplicative has not been assessed.
   Ecological theory suggests that systems with greater functional
   redundancy (alternative hosts) will be more resilient to the loss of
   sympatric hosts. We test this theory and show its importance in relation
   to pest/pathogen impact assessments. We assessed the potential impact on
   biodiversity of the loss of two widely occurring sympatric European tree
   species, Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus petraea/robur, both of which are
   currently threatened by a range of pests and pathogens. At the UK scale,
   the total number of associated species at risk of extirpation from plant
   diseases affecting these two sympatric hosts is greater than the sum of
   the associated species at risk from declines in either host alone. F.
   excelsior hosts 45 obligate species (species only found on that host)
   and Q. petraea/robur hosts 326. However, a decline in both these trees
   would impact 512 associated species, across multiple taxon groups, a
   38\% increase. Assessments at a local scale, 24 mixed F. excelsior-Q.
   petraea/robur woodlands revealed that these impacts may be even greater
   due to a lack of functional redundancy. Only 21\% of sites were able to
   provide functional redundancy for F. excelsior and Q. petraea/robur
   associated species which can use other tree species. In most woodlands,
   the tree species required to provide functional redundancy were not
   present, although the site conditions were often suitable for them to
   grow. Synthesis. Understanding of functional redundancy should be
   applied to assessments of pests/pathogens impact on biodiversity. In
   risk assessments, higher impact scores should be given to
   pests/pathogens affecting hosts occurring with other host plant species
   already impacted by pests/pathogens. Current pest/pathogen risk
   assessment approaches that ignore the cumulative, cascading effects
   shown in this study may allow an insidious, mostly overlooked, driver of
   biodiversity loss to continue.},

   effects assessment},
Journal = {WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {361-373},
Abstract = {White sucker (Catostomus commersoni) are widely distributed in North
   America and are often used in environmental monitoring. Whole organism
   characteristics of three white sucker populations determined to be
   resident (outside of spawning) within small sections of the Saint John
   River, New Brunswick, were studied in 2001 and 2002. Significant
   differences in performance characteristics were present among sites. The
   differences can be interpreted as either improved sucker performance at
   Florenceville (upstream site), or decreased performance at Woodstock.
   Without further investigation it is difficult to identify whether the
   apparent improved performance is a response to nutrient enrichment, or
   increased mortality associated with the recent prevalence of lesions.
   Confounding factors are also present. Daily water level fluctuations
   resulting from an upstream dam discharge may change habitat availability
   and/or diversity, thereby altering the fish community. Liver sizes in
   Saint John River white sucker are considerably larger than in fish
   collected in Ontario, but are not relative to nearby New Brunswick river
   populations. This has implications for the importance of reference site
   selection and understanding the natural variability within a species
   (intra-specific variation) on multiple spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Accurate prediction of runoff signatures is important for numerous
   hydrological and water resources applications. However, there are lack
   of comprehensive evaluations of various approaches for predicting
   hydrological signatures. This study, for the first time, introduces
   regression tree ensemble approach and compares it with other three
   widely used approaches (multiple linear regression, multiple
   log-transformed linear regression, and hydrological modeling) for
   assessing prediction accuracy of 13 runoff characteristics or
   signatures, using a large data set from 605 catchments across Australia.
   The climate, in particular, mean annual precipitation and aridity index,
   has the most significant influence on the runoff signatures. Physical
   catchment attributes including forest ratio, slope, and soil water
   holding capacity also have significant influence (p < 0.05) on the
   runoff signatures. All four approaches can predict the long-term average
   and high flow signatures accurately. The regression approaches can also
   well predict majority of the other runoff signatures, with the
   Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency larger than 0.60. The regression tree ensemble
   outperforms the two linear regressions in predicting signatures of flow
   dynamics. The hydrological models, calibrated to one specific objective
   criterion, cannot predict many of the runoff signatures, particularly
   those reflecting low flows and flow dynamics. This is because in most
   hydrological model applications, the simulations allow satisfactory
   predictions of long-term average and high flow signatures. In
   applications where a specific runoff signature is needed, regression
   relationships that directly relate that runoff signature to catchment
   attributes give the best predictions. Here the regression tree ensemble
   is overall best and offers significant potential, being able to predict
   most of the runoff signatures very well.},

Title = {A novel approach for cumulative impacts assessment for marine spatial
   planning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {125-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The assessment of the cumulative impacts of multiple human activities is
   an increasingly important yet complex part of managing the marine
   environment. Despite this, as yet, there is no consistent approach to
   considering these in assessments and/or management (e.g. environmental
   impact assessment, marine spatial planning). Current and previous
   approaches to the assessment of cumulative impacts have limitations and
   shortcomings e.g. double counting of impacts or avoiding, complicating
   and confounding impacts, which need to be addressed to allow for
   pragmatic decisions to be made. Here, an innovative, practical approach
   to marine CIA is presented that considers the three dimensional nature
   of the marine environment, and the spatial and temporal
   effects-footprints likely to occur during the lifetime of a development.
   The new approach is tested within a GIS platform and shows an effective
   visual representation for decision makers, managers and policy makers on
   which to base their decisions. While showing potential, the approach
   indicates the need to incorporate temporal data and assessing temporal
   trends. Despite this limitation, the tool markedly improves on previous
   approaches due to the national and practical application, and the
   incorporation of 3D nature of pressures and receptors.},

Title = {Levels and determinants of urinary phthalate metabolites in Chinese
   community-dwelling older adults},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {762},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Biomonitoring studies have demonstrated extensive exposure
   of infants, children, and pregnant women to phthalates, but data on
   phthalate exposure and their determinants in Chinese older adults remain
   insufficient. This study aims to assess urinary phthalate metabolite
   levels, individual and cumulative exposure risk, and their determinants
   in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.
   Methods: A total 01987 individuals aged 60 years or over were included
   in this study. The urinary levels of seven phthalate metabolites were
   measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry. The estimated daily intake (EDI), hazard quotient (HQ),
   and hazard index (HI) of phthalates were calculated based on urinary
   metabolite levels. The associations between phthalate metabolite levels
   and potential determinants were examined using multiple linear
   regressions.
   Results: Detection rates of seven phthalate metabolites from the study
   population ranged from 63.83\% to 99.39\%. The highest median
   concentration was 43.64 mu g/L (42.59 mu g/g creatinine) for mono-butyl
   phthalate (MBP). The highest median EDI was 1.55 mu g/kg-bw/day for
   diethyl phthalate (DBP). Nearly 5\% of participants had high HI values
   exceeding 1, mainly attributed to DBP and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate
   (DEHP). Furthermore, we found that females, higher body mass index
   (BMI), smoking, having two or more chronic diseases, and vegetable-based
   diets were significantly associated with higher levels of parts of
   phthalate metabolites. More interestingly, higher urine levels of
   high-molecular-weight (HMW) phthalate metabolites and lower urine levels
   of low-molecular-weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites were found in rural
   older adults than in urban older adults.
   Conclusions: Chinese community-dwelling older adults are extensively
   exposed to phthalates, especially to DBP and DEHP. More attention should
   be paid to urban-rural differences in exposure to HMW and LMW phthalates
   and to phthalate exposure among older adults with overweight/obesity,
   females, and individuals who are current heavy smokers, have two or more
   chronic diseases, and consume vegetable-based diets. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Developing an Environmental Impact Assessment for Floating Island
   Applications},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {In the Space@Sea project a conceptual study is performed to develop
   standardized cost efficient floating modular islands with low
   environmental impact. As these floating modular islands are introduced
   for a purpose which is likely to determine the environmental impact,
   possible applications were considered: living, aquaculture, ports and
   logistics, and energy hub. The aim of this study is to develop a
   structured approach for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) of
   floating modular islands and their applications as these are considered
   within the Space@Sea project. To contribute to the efficiency and
   sustainability of future floating island developments, early awareness
   of the likely environmental consequences is important and requires a
   solid knowledge base. To that end we recommend a screening approach to
   identify the main threats to the marine ecosystem and their potential
   impacts at the earliest (conceptual) stage of development. For each
   Space@Sea type of application, this screening approach should identify
   the main threats through an EIA that links critical pressures with
   sensitive ecosystem components. While conventional impact assessments
   only consider negative impacts, we also consider potential environmental
   benefits of floating islands. This not only to enhance more
   environmental-friendly designs but also to provide a balanced
   perspective which considers not only threats but also opportunities in
   future developments and implementation of floating islands and their
   applications.},

Abstract = {To analyze the cumulative risks to the water environment, the
   backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), a self-adapting
   algorithm, was proposed in this study. A new comprehensive indicator of
   cumulative risks was formed by combining the water risk assessment tool
   proposed by the World Wide Fund for Nature or World Wildlife Fund (WWF),
   Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG), and the
   cumulative environmental risk assessment system proposed by the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Eleven training algorithms were
   selected and optimized based on the mean square error (MSE) of
   prediction results. Data concerning evaluating indicators and cumulative
   risk indexes of the Liao River collected from 2005 to 2017 in the cities
   of Tieling, Shenyang, and Panjin, China, were used as input and output
   data to train, validate, and test the BP-ANN. Levenberg Marquardt
   backpropagation was the most accurate algorithm, with an MSE of 3.33 x
   10(-6). After optimization, there were six hidden layers in the model.
   The correlation coefficient of the BP-ANN with LM exceeded 80\%. These
   findings suggest that the BP-ANN model is applicable to prediction of
   cumulative risks to the water environment. The model was sensitive to
   the number of wastewater treatment facilities and the wastewater
   treatment rate along the river. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the
   contributing factors can be controlled to reduce the cumulative risk.},

Abstract = {This investigation examines the extent of soil metal pollution
   associated with the Green Revolution, relative to agricultural
   activities and associated risks to health in the most important
   agricultural region of Mexico. Metal contents in bulk soil samples are
   commonly used to assess contamination, and metal accumulations in soils
   are usually assumed to increase with decreasing particle size. This
   study profiled the spatial distribution of metals (Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, Fe,
   Cd, V. Hg, Co, P. Se, and Mn) in bulk soil and fine-grained fractions
   (soil-derived dust) from 22 towns and cities. The contamination of soil
   was assessed through the use of a geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and
   pollution index (PI). The results of this study indicated that a number
   of towns and cities are moderately to highly polluted by soil containing
   Be, Co, Hg, P. 5, V. Zn, Se, Cr, and Pb in both size fractions (coarse
   and fine). Hazard index in fine fraction (HIchildren = 2.1) shows that
   risk assessment based on Co, Mn, V. and Ni spatially related to power
   plants, have the potential to pose health risks to local residents,
   especially children. This study shows that risk assessment based on
   metal content in bulk soil could be overestimated when compared to
   fine-grained fraction. Our results provide important information that
   could be valuable in establishing risk assessment associated with
   residential soils within agricultural areas, where children can ingest
   and inhale dust. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecological risk assessment (ERA) methodologies must be continually
   improved so that resource managers, activity proponents, and
   stakeholders can better manage the environmental impacts of human
   activities. One of the largest challenges facing ERA methodologies and
   approaches is to develop the ability to encompass cumulative and
   far-field effects of human activities. It is argued here that the ERAs
   of industrial aquaculture activities have been an example of where ERA
   practitioners and researchers have responded to the challenge of
   managing the cumulative risks of a new and rapidly growing industry by
   developing innovative ERA approaches that can be applied elsewhere.},

Title = {Human pressures on UK seabed habitats: a cumulative impact assessment},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {428},
Pages = {33-47},
Abstract = {European Member States are required to assess the status of marine
   waters, including analysis of cumulative effects. We developed a
   methodology for evaluating the impact of several human activities that
   constitute 4 direct pressures on the UK (England and Wales) seabed
   community: smothering, abrasion, obstruction (sealing), and extraction.
   The method was tested by mapping the spatial extent of individual and
   cumulative activities for 2007 by habitat type, quantifying the
   intensity of activities, and estimating impact using published recovery
   times. More than half (134 400 km(2)) of the seabed was directly
   affected by human activities, of which only 165 km(2) (<0.1\%) was
   occupied by multiple activities. Benthic fishing accounted for 99.6\% of
   the spatial footprint. Sensitivity to the pressures of human activities
   varied by habitat type, with estimated recovery times ranging from <1 mo
   for otter trawling in sand, to similar to 15 yr for co-occurring
   aggregate extraction and dredge material disposal in low-energy gravel
   habitat. Fully integrated, dynamically-linked environmental assessments
   are generally considered desirable for greater scientific understanding
   of an ecosystem. The methodology we present for quantifying cumulative
   effects is a step towards this. However, our findings indicate that a
   limited number of activities were the predominant cause of widespread,
   long recovery times of benthic fauna. This suggests that when time and
   resources are limited, single sector assessment rather than detailed
   evaluation of cumulative effects, can still usefully guide management.
   As the observed cumulative effects were primarily related to a few
   activities, it might reasonably be argued that management effort should
   be focused on spatially extensive activities, such as benthic fishing to
   mitigate most of the human impact on the UK seabed.},

Abstract = {Despite being adopted worldwide, environmental impact assessment (EIA)
   is under pressure in many countries, while perceived (rightly or
   wrongly) as an ineffective and inefficient process. Strategic
   environmental assessment (SEA) is thought to help address some of EIA's
   shortcomings, but it is absent in many jurisdictions and sectors. In
   this paper, we argue that multi-project EIA can, in some contexts,
   simultaneously deliver greater effectiveness and process streamlining.
   To illustrate our claim, we present a case study from offshore petroleum
   production in Brazil, where the development of the pre-salt giant
   reserves is being licensed through a multi-project EIA approach, in a
   non-SEA planning environment. The analysis provides interesting insights
   on the strengths and challenges of that strategy, focusing on five
   aspects of practice: cumulative impacts, efficiency, approach to
   authorizations, follow-up and political issues. Proper scoping was found
   to be essential to consistent EIA processes and shorter review times.
   Finally, we suggest that multi-project EIA approach should be revisited
   by practitioners and regulators to identify opportunities for
   deployment, especially in jurisdictions where strategic assessments are
   not in place.},

Title = {Exposure and cumulative risk assessment to non-persistent pesticides in
   Spanish children using biomonitoring},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {746},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The main objective of the present research is to evaluate the exposure
   to pesticides in children (n = 568) from the Valencian Region (Spain).
   Six non-specific and 20 specific metabolites of organophosphate
   pesticides (OPs), herbicides (Herb), and pyrethroids (Pyr) were analyzed
   in urine samples. The biomarkers with the highest detection frequencies
   (>70\%) were diethyl phosphate, p-nitrophenol, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid,
   and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, whose geometric mean concentrations
   (ng.ml-n1) were 1.53, 1.03, 1.51 and 1.19, respectively. Robust
   regression models showed that the province of residence and the recent
   consumption of vegetables, legumes and cereals were some of the most
   important predictors of pesticide exposure. Pesticide risk assessment is
   estimated using two different strategies: one based on the pesticides'
   mode of action (MoA); and the other based on cumulative assessment
   groups (CAGs), proposed by EFSA. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs)
   ranged from 0.08 (chlorpyrifos) to 1.62 mu g.kgbw(-1)
   (lambda-cyhalothrin). The MoA approach resulted in hazard quotients
   ranging from 0.01 (chlorpyrifos) to 0.65 (lambda-cyhalothrin), and a
   hazard index for OPs lower than 1. Similarly, the risk assessment based
   on CAGs led to total margins of exposure (MOETs) far from 100. In
   conclusion, both risk assessment strategies does not reveal any evidence
   of a potential health risk due to pesticide exposure in Spanish
   children. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {155},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Few studies have investigated the association of gestational exposure to
   phthalate with metabolic risk and have reached inconsistent conclusions.
   Based on the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort, 3273 women were included in the
   present study. All participants provided up to three urine samples for 7
   phthalate metabolite measurements. The hazard index (HI) was used to
   evaluate the cumulative risk of multiple phthalate coexposures. The
   outcomes of interest included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
   (HDOP), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weight gain
   (GWG). The incidences of HDOP, GDM, and excessive GWG were 5.93\%,
   13.09\%, and 28.95\%, respectively. Exposure to a single phthalate
   metabolite or a specific diester during the first trimester of pregnancy
   elevated blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the
   third trimester and body weight gain throughout pregnancy. However,
   inverse relationships were revealed for some phthalate metabolites,
   which were inconsistent with the results of their diesters. The HI value
   during the first trimester was positively associated with subsequent BP,
   FPG, and GWG. In addition, HI during the first trimester increased the
   risks of GDM {[}odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)
   = 1.02-1.75)] and excessive GWG (OR = 1.76, 95\% CIs = 1.41-2.19) in a
   linear manner thereafter. Notably, phthalates might directly increase
   maternal blood glucose and pressure, and these changes were secondary
   effects of the obesiogenic effects of certain phthalates. In conclusion,
   exposure to single and multiple phthalates during the first trimester of
   pregnancy increased the risks of maternal metabolic syndrome components.
   However, the conflicting findings between phthalates and their
   metabolites need to be interpreted carefully.},

Abstract = {This special issue covers the main results of the European Sixth
   Framework Integrated Research project NoMiracle (Novel Methods for Risk
   Assessment of Cumulative stressors in Europe). New tools to analyse.
   characterise and quantify the combined risks to health or the
   environment from multiple stressors are presented or reviewed. Examples
   of cumulative stressors are mixtures of chemicals alone or in
   combination with biological or physical environmental factors such as
   pathogens and climate extremes. Among the main findings, the scientific
   work points at the importance of time in dealing with toxicity, and in
   particular the toxicity of chemical mixtures, the natures of the
   uncertainties associated with risk assessment and the value of
   visualisation in identifying and quantifying the most relevant risks. A
   major conclusion of the project is that researchers and regulators
   should focus on the receptor rather than on the single stressor or
   combination of agents. There is also a need for more efforts on
   mechanistic understanding and for a mechanism-based framework for
   interpreting mixture/multiple stressor effects. The new tools are

Abstract = {The assessment of cumulative impacts is one of the most difficult tasks
   a NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) practitioner faces when
   preparing an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
   and it recently has become an increasing focus area of legal challenges.
   Historically, federal agencies have a very poor track record in this
   litigation. This research examines 25 recent judicial opinions involving
   challenges to various NEPA documents' cumulative impact analyses, from
   the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Challengers were victorious
   on their claims of inadequate analysis in 60\% of the cases decided in
   the 10-year analysis period. In recent years, the success rate for
   challengers has risen even higher, to victories in eight of 11 cases
   (72\%). The main reasons federal agencies have lost these court
   challenges is because they failed to present any cumulative impact
   analysis whatsoever in their NEPA document; they left out obvious past,
   present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions; or they provided
   undocumented assertions that their projects would not cause any
   cumulative impacts. Four key lessons for practitioners emerge from the
   results: (1) Make sure to include a discussion of cumulative impacts for
   each resource and include all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
   future actions; (2) Do not make unsubstantiated claims about cumulative
   impacts; (3) Assessments do not have to be perfect but should be
   thorough and based on data and explained rationales; and (4) Do not tie
   assessments solely to programmatic or non-NEPA documents.},

Abstract = {Phthalate exposure monitoring and risk assessment in non-toilet-trained
   children are rarely reported. This adjunct study of the Japan
   Environment and Children's Study assessed cumulative health risks in
   1.5-year-old toddlers in the Aichi regional subcohort by biomonitoring
   16 urinary metabolites of eight phthalate plasticizers. Overnight urine
   was extracted from toddlers' diapers (n = 1077), and metabolites were
   quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with
   tandem mass spectrometry. The analyses' quality was assured by running
   quality control samples. The highest geometric mean concentration was
   found for mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate, followed by
   mono-isobutyl phthalate (23 and 21 mu g/L, respectively). Di-2ethylhexyl
   phthalate (DEHP) and di-butyl phthalate exhibited higher risks {[}hazard
   quotient (HQ) > 1] than the cutoff level in a small proportion of
   toddlers; 8 and 14\% of toddlers were at cumulative risk of multiple
   phthalates beyond the cutoff level {[}hazard index, (HI) > 1], based on
   the tolerable daily intake of the European Food Safety Authority and the
   United States Environmental Protection Agency Reference Dose. HI > 1 for
   antiandrogenicity in creatinine-unadjusted and-adjusted estimations were
   exhibited by 36 and 23\% of the children, respectively. Thus,
   identifying exposure sources and mitigating exposure are necessary for
   risk management. Additionally, continuous exposure assessment and
   evaluation of health outcomes, especially antiandrogenic effects, are
   warranted.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {The health effects of non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls
   (NDL-PCBs) include liver, immune, neurodevelopmental, and
   neurobehavioral effects in addition to hormone alteration. Among 209 PCB
   congeners, six indicator PCBs (ICES-6) account for about half of
   NDL-PCBs present in feed and food. The objectives of the current study
   were first to examine the levels of total PCBs, NDL-PCBs, and ICES-6
   PCBs in 200 foods commonly consumed in Taiwan and, second, to estimate
   the cumulative health risks of NDL-PCB consumption. We suggest a risk
   management strategy that identifies foodstuffs with particularly high
   NDL-PCB content. In 200 food samples, which were grouped into 12
   categories and 64 food types, 51 PCB congeners were detected. The
   concentrations of ICES-6 PCBs in all samples were lower than the maximum
   levels for NDL-PCBs in foodstuffs set by the European Union. PCB-153,
   PCB-138, and PCB-180 were the major congeners in all food, indicating
   that the food was contaminated in the past. ICES-6 PCBs contributed
   42.2\%-52.9\% of total NDL-PCBs in all tested foodstuffs. The average
   estimated daily intake (EDI) of PCBs ranged from 1.22 ng/kg bw/day to
   2.89 ng/kg bw/day in different age groups (95th quantile {[}P95]:
   4.12-10.28 ng/kg bw/day). The P95 EDI in 3e6-year-olds was higher than
   10 ng/kg/day. A qualitative sensitivity analysis in ICES-6 PCBs exposure
   showed that for the 3- to 6-year-old group, the highest sensitivity was
   how much fish they ate (37.6\%) and its concentration (32.5\%). The
   consumption of pork, eggs, fish, and other seafood accounts for over
   90\% of ICES-6 PCBs intake, and these foods should be highlighted in
   guidelines regarding NDL-PCB intake. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is a natural nonchemical stressor posing
   potential hazards to organisms such as planktonic crustaceans. The
   present study was conducted to revisit the lethal effects of UVB on
   crustaceans, generate new experimental evidence to fill in knowledge
   gaps, and develop novel quantitative adverse outcome pathways (qAOPs)
   for UVB. A combination of laboratory and computational approaches was
   deployed to achieve the goals. For targeted laboratory tests, Daphnia
   magna was used as a prototype and exposed to a gradient of artificial
   UVB. Targeted bioassays were used to quantify the effects of UVB at
   multiple levels of biological organization. A toxicity pathway network
   was assembled based on the new experimental evidence and previously
   published data extracted using a novel computational tool, the NIVA Risk
   Assessment Database (NIVA RAdb). A network of AOPs was developed, and
   weight of evidence was assessed based on a combination of the current
   and existing data. In addition, quantitative key event relationships in
   the AOPs were developed by fitting the D. magna data to predefined
   models. A complete workflow for assembly and evaluation of qAOPs has
   been presented, which may serve as a good example for future de novo
   qAOP development for chemical and nonchemical stressors.},

Title = {Estimated Daily Intake and Cumulative Risk Assessment of Phthalates in
   the General Taiwanese after the 2011 DEHP Food Scandal},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {A food scandal occurred in Taiwan in 2011 because the DEHP
   (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) had been intentionally used in food
   products. We assessed the daily intakes (DIs) and cumulative risk of
   phthalates in Taiwan's general population after the scandal. The DIs of
   6 phthalates, including di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-iso-butyl
   phthalate (DiBP), and DEHP, were evaluated using urinary phthalate
   metabolites. Hazard quotients of phthalates classified as affecting the
   reproductive (HQrep) and hepatic (HQhep) systems were assessed using
   cumulative approach. The creatinine-based model showed that the highest
   DI values in children 7-to 12-years-old were for DEHP (males: median:
   4.79 mu g/kg bw/d; females: median: 2.62 mu g/kg bw/d). The 95th
   percentile (P95) of HQrep values were all >1 in the 7-to 12-year-old and
   18- to 40-year-old male groups. The P95 of HQhep values were all >1 in
   the 7- to 18-year-old male groups. Most of the HQrep was attributable to
   the HQs of DnBP and DiBP (53.9-84.7\%), and DEHP contributed most to
   HQhep (83.1-98.6\%), which reveals that DnBP, DiBP and DEHP were the
   main risk of phthalate exposure for Taiwanese. Taiwan's general
   population is widely exposed to DnBP, DiBP and DEHP, especially for
   young children.},

Title = {Recovery of UK seabed habitats from benthic fishing and aggregate
   extraction-towards a cumulative impact assessment},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {411},
Pages = {259-270},
Abstract = {Assessing cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on the marine
   environment can help inform management response. This requires
   understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of human
   pressures and their impacts. Quantifying seabed recovery rates from 2
   significant pressures in European waters, benthic fishing and aggregate
   extraction, is a significant step towards assessing sensitivity and
   cumulative impacts. Vessel monitoring system data were used to estimate
   the distribution and intensity of benthic fishing in UK (England and
   Wales) marine waters (2006 to 2007). Data were separated by towed
   bottom-fishing gears (scallop dredges, beam and otter trawls) and linked
   to habitat in a geographic information system. Recovery periods of
   seabed habitats were estimated by literature review, for gear types and
   fishing intensity. Recovery rates generally increased with sediment
   hardness, and habitats required longer periods of recovery from scallop
   dredging than from otter or beam trawling. Fishing pressure across the
   habitat-gear combinations was such that 80\% of the bottom-fished area
   was estimated to be able to recover completely before repeat trawling,
   based on mean annual trawl frequencies. However, in 19\% of the UK's
   bottom-fished seabed, scallop dredging in sand and gravel and otter
   trawling in muddy sand and reef habitats occurred at frequencies that
   prevented full habitat recovery. In 2007, benthic fishing and aggregate
   extraction occurred together in an estimated 40 km(2) (<0.02\%) of the
   UK seabed. Cumulative impacts were estimated as total recovery time
   under 4 scenarios: greatest, additive, antagonistic and synergistic
   impacts. Recovery from aggregate extraction required much greater
   periods than from benthic fishing, and gravel was identified as a more
   sensitive habitat than sand.},

Title = {Mechanisms for the inclusion of cumulative impacts in conservation
   decision-making are sensitive to vulnerability and irreplaceability in a
   stochastically simulated landscape},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {265-271},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is commonly understood that the cumulative impact of increased
   habitat destruction on biological systems does not scale linearly.
   Despite this, current environmental decision-making strategies often
   fail to incorporate these non-linearities because impact assessments are
   regularly performed independently without considering contributions to
   future cumulative impacts, which are, instead, externalised to the
   environment. Here we used a stochastic modelling framework to examine
   the effect of three decision-making strategies - externalised,
   individually-borne and shared cumulative costs - on the number of
   species driven to extinction by the development of a region. We also
   tested how different levels of vulnerability (quantified as the
   correlation between development benefits and species richness) and
   irreplaceability (expressed as the average area of occupancy of an
   assemblage) influence the outcomes of development. Overall, the
   inclusion of cumulative impacts in our simulations resulted in the
   destruction of fewer patches and, as a consequence, more modest benefits
   obtained from developments. Moreover, these patterns were strongest when
   cumulative costs were shared by all developers. The most striking
   finding was that the distinction between decision-making strategies was
   highest in landscapes of high vulnerability and irreplaceability.
   Environmental decision-makers are recommended to commit to a strategy
   for incorporating the cumulative costs of development because, as this
   study suggests, this affects the endpoints of conservation and
   development considerably; especially in the most vulnerable and
   irreplaceable landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Modeling the impact of revegetation on regional water quality: A
   collective approach to manage the cumulative impacts of mining in the
   Bowen Basin, Australia},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {670-677},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we quantify the additional water quality benefits that can
   be achieved through coordinated cumulative impact management. To do this
   we simulate coordinated and un-coordinated revegetation investments and
   compare their impact on achieving regional water quality goals. Our
   results show that coordination between multiple mining companies
   achieves additional benefits since prioritization is enabled across a
   broader range of investment opportunities. Additionally, when
   coordinated investment is permitted beyond the boundaries of coal mining
   leases, results show that additional benefits are greatly enhanced since
   these regions provide more rewarding investment opportunities. Results
   illustrate (a) how regional coordination may influence reputational
   benefits of investments, and (b) that coordination is beneficial when
   investment opportunities are unevenly distributed across the landscape.
   When additional benefits are achievable, we suggest that mining
   companies should develop collective investment projects with an
   understanding of how coordination influences project costs. Similarly,
   investment projects should be developed with an understanding of
   investment tradeoffs and how these may adversely impact on regional
   stakeholders and hence industry reputation. The mining industry has
   significant potential to contribute to regional wellbeing; however, land
   management policies must be flexible and promote incentives to enable
   companies to invest beyond compliance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Population growth, during the twentieth century, has increased demand
   for new farmlands. Accordingly, road networks have rapidly been
   developed to facilitate and accelerate human access to the essential
   resources resulted in extensive land use changes. The present study aims
   at assessing cumulative effects of developed road network on tree cover
   of Golestan Province in northern Iran. In order to detect changes over
   the study period of 1987-2002, the LULC map of the study area was
   initially prepared from the satellite images of Landsat TM (1987) and
   ETM+ (2002) using maximum likelihood supervised classification method.
   Afterwards, a total number of seven landscape matrices were selected to
   detect cumulative effects of the developed road network on woodland
   cover. The obtained results indicated that the fragile patches are
   mainly located at a distance of 171-342 m from the roadside.
   Furthermore, the majority of the patches affected by cumulative effects
   of development activities are situated at a distance of 342-684 m from
   the roadside, over an approximate area of 55 ha. The analysis of
   landscape metrics revealed that the developed road network has increased
   the landscape metrics of ``the number of patches{''} and ``patches
   perimeter-area ratio{''}. It has also followed by a decrease in metrics
   such as ``patches area{''}, ``Euclidean nearest neighbor distance{''},
   ``patches proximity{''}, ``shape index{''}, ``contiguity{''}, and ``mean
   patches fractal dimension{''}. The road network has also increased the
   ``number of patches{''} and decreased the ``mean patches area{''}
   representing further fragmentation of the landscape. With identification
   of highly affected wooldland cover patches, it would be possible to
   apply adaptive environmental management strategies to preserve and
   rehabilitate high-priority patches.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While directly comparable toxicological data are unavailable, this pilot
   study used published toxicological endpoints for neurological damage to
   weigh the relative importance of cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury,
   nickel, and aluminum in the mixture Finnish adults receive from their
   daily diet. In addition, the effects of a selection of these chemicals
   on cognition, kidney tubular damage, and fertility were assessed using
   the toxicological endpoints available in the Chemical Mixture Calculator
   developed by the Technical University of Denmark. Consumption data from
   the FinDiet 2012 national survey of 25 to 74-year-olds and occurrence
   data mainly obtained in national monitoring were used to estimate the
   cumulative dietary exposure, which was found to be so high that the
   possibility of neurological damage or kidney effects cannot be ruled out
   for most of the population, particularly fertile age women. For Finns
   below the age of 65 years, the main sources of cumulative exposure were
   bread and other cereals, non-alcoholic drinks, and vegetables. When mean
   exposure was statistically compared between age groups and genders,
   women aged 25 to 45 years had a statistically significantly higher
   exposure than men of the same age (P < 0.05) and women aged 46 to 64
   years (P < 0.001).},

Abstract = {Fundamental to regulatory guidelines is to identify chemicals that are
   implicated with adverse human health effects and inform public health
   risk assessors about ``acceptable ranges{''} of such environmental
   exposures (e.g., from consumer products and pesticides). The process is
   made more difficult when accounting for complex human exposures to
   multiple environmental chemicals. Herein we propose a new class of
   nonlinear statistical models for human data that incorporate and
   evaluate regulatory guideline values into analyses of health effects of
   exposure to chemical mixtures using so-called `desirability functions'
   (DFs). The DFs are incorporated into nonlinear regression models to
   allow for the simultaneous estimation of points of departure for risk
   assessment of combinations of individual substances that are parts of
   chemical mixtures detected in humans. These are, in contrast to
   published so-called biomonitoring equivalent (BE) values and human
   biomonitoring (HBM) values that link regulatory guideline values from in
   vivo studies of single chemicals to internal concentrations monitored in
   humans. We illustrate the strategy through the analysis of prenatal
   concentrations of mixtures of 11 chemicals with suspected endocrine
   disrupting properties and two health effects: birth weight and language
   delay at 2.5 years. The strategy allows for the creation of a Mixture
   Desirability Function i.e., MDF, which is a uni-dimensional construct of
   the set of single chemical DFs; thus, it focuses the resulting inference
   to a single dimension for a more powerful one degree-of-freedom test of
   significance. Based on the application of this new method we conclude
   that the guideline values need to be lower than those for single
   chemicals when the chemicals are observed in combination to achieve a
   similar level of protection as was aimed for the individual chemicals.
   The proposed modeling may thus suggest data-driven uncertainty factors
   for single chemical risk assessment that takes environmental mixtures
   into account.},

Title = {The use of aggregate complaints data as an indicator of cumulative
   social impacts of mining: A case study from the Hunter valley, NSW,
   Australia},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {704-712},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Generally speaking, there is a greater amount of quantitative data
   available to measure and model the cumulative environmental or economic
   impacts of mining than the social impacts. In part, this is because
   social impacts are often inherently more difficult to quantify, but
   historically there have also been fewer regulatory drivers for companies
   or state agencies to invest in collecting such data. Regulators in some
   jurisdictions are now starting to require resource companies to report
   on aspects of their social performance, but companies and regulators are
   still struggling to identify appropriate metrics, particularly in
   regards to cumulative impacts. This paper describes an innovative
   quantitative approach to tracking how communities experience and respond
   to increased mining activity, using data from the complaints registers
   maintained by mines located in the Upper Hunter Valley in New South
   Wales, Australia. In this study, complaints lodged with five separate
   mines adjacent to the township of Muswellbrook over several years were
   aggregated and trends analysed. The aggregated set showed that complaint
   frequency increased with the increase in mining activity but then
   decreased as individual complaints were addressed. However, when
   complaints from near-neighbours were removed, it emerged that the
   proportion of complaints that came from the town itself steadily
   increased over time. Further analysis indicated that this increase was
   closely associated with the amount of mine-disturbed land that could be
   seen from the town over time, as measured using a combination of
   remotely sensed data and a digital elevation model. This is persuasive
   evidence of a cumulative social impact that is more than just the sum of
   the local impacts of individual mines. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Title = {Time course of phthalate cumulative risks to male developmental health
   over a 27-year period: Biomonitoring samples of the German Environmental
   Specimen Bank},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {137},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In several human biomonitoring surveys, changes in the usage patterns of
   phthalates have come to light, but their influence on the risks
   associated with combined exposures is insufficiently understood. Based
   on the largest study to date, the 27-year survey of urinary phthalate
   metabolite levels in 24-hour urine samples from the German Environmental
   Specimen Bank, we present a deep analysis of changing phthalate
   exposures on mixture risks. This analysis adopts the Hazard Index (HI)
   approach based on the five phthalates DBP, DIBP, BBP, DEHP and DINP.
   Calculations of the hazard index for each study participant included
   updated phthalate reference doses for anti-androgenicity (RfD(AA)s) that
   take account of new evidence of phthalates' developmental toxicity.
   The Maximum Cumulative Ratio (MCR) approach was used to establish
   whether a subject's combined exposure was dominated by one phthalate or
   was influenced by several phthalates simultaneously. Generally, over the
   years there was a shift towards lower HIs and higher MCRs, reflecting an
   increased complexity of the combined exposures. The decade from 1988 to
   about 1999 was characterised by rather high HIs of between 3 and 7 (95th
   percentile) which were driven by exposure to DBP and DEHP, often
   exceeding their single acceptable exposures. Traditional single
   phthalate risk assessments would have underestimated these risks by up
   to 50\%. From 2006 onwards, no study participant experienced exposures
   above acceptable levels for a single phthalate, but combined exposures
   were still in excess of HI = 1. From 2011 onwards most individuals
   stayed below HI = 1. In interpreting these results, we caution against
   the use of HI = 1 as an acceptable limit and develop proposals for
   improved and more realistic mixture risk assessments that take account
   of co-exposures to other anti-androgenic substances also capable of
   disrupting the male reproductive system. From this perspective, we
   regard HIs between 0.1 and 0.2 as more appropriate for evaluating
   combined phthalate exposures. Assessed against lowered HIs of 0.1 - 0.2,
   the combined phthalate exposures of most study participants exceeded
   acceptable levels in all study years, including 2015. Continued
   monitoring efforts for phthalate combinations are required to provide
   the basis for appropriate risk management measures.},

Title = {Relationships among phthalate exposure, oxidative stress, and insulin
   resistance in young military soldiers: A cumulative risk assessment and
   mediation approach},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Epidemiological studies concerning whether oxidative stress
   mediates phthalate exposure-insulin resistance (IR) associations in
   young adults are limited. Therefore, we investigated this potential
   mediation by using a cumulative risk approach involving daily intake
   (DI) and a hazard index (HIRfD).Methods: The participants were 391
   Taiwanese military personnel. This study measured their IR (as
   homeostatic model assessment of estimated IR {[}HOMA-IR]), levels of
   oxidative stress biomarkers (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 8-nitroguanine,
   8-iso-prostaglandin F2 alpha, and
   N-acetyl-S-{[}tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-2-pentyl-3-furanyl]-Lcysteine
   {[}HNE-MA]), the sum of these four biomarkers (Sigma OS), and urinary
   phthalate metabolite concentrations. The HIRfD was estimated on the
   basis of urinary levels of phthalate metabolite, and the DI of five
   phthalates was determined: dimethyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate
   (BBzP), diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di
   (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Logistic regression models were
   employed to explore associations among DI, HIRfD, oxidative stress
   biomarkers, and HOMA-IR values. The role played by oxidative stress in
   the phthalate exposure-HOMA-IR association was determined using
   mediation analysis.Results: We discovered positive associations between
   high DI of DBP, BBzP, and DEHP; high HIRfD; and high Sigma OS. High
   Sigma OS and HNE-MA were associated with a higher likelihood of a high
   HOMA-IR value. Mediation analysis indicated that high Sigma OS and
   HNE-MA were significant mediators of the associations between phthalates
   and IR.Conclusion: Oxidative stress may partially mediate the
   phthalate-IR relationship in young adults.},

Abstract = {q Australia has experienced rapid development within its resource
   regions, with traditional mining sectors like coal, iron-ore and natural
   gas expanding and new industries such as coal seam gas emerging. As a
   result, there is an increasing prevalence and awareness of the
   cumulative impacts of the extractive resource industries on the society,
   environment and economy of these regions. Collaborative governance is
   emerging as a means of addressing cumulative impacts. This article
   undertakes an analysis of 30 case studies of collaborative governance in
   the resources sector of Australia. The initiatives analysed range from
   those focussed on information exchange and coordination to higher
   degrees of collaboration that involve shared resources and shared risks.
   The study demonstrates that there are challenges in using collaborative
   approaches to tackle cumulative impacts, but that significant benefits
   can be realised. The study highlights the need to nurture and cultivate
   collaborative relationships in order to provide the foundation for
   long-term solutions. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are under high demand for human use, giving concerns
   about how pressures from human activities may affect their structure,
   function, and status. In Europe, recent developments in mapping of
   marine habitats and human activities now enable a coherent spatial
   evaluation of potential combined effects of human activities. Results
   indicate that combined effects from multiple human pressures are spread
   to 96\% of the European marine area, and more specifically that combined
   effects from physical disturbance are spread to 86\% of the coastal area
   and 46\% of the shelf area. We compare our approach with corresponding
   assessments at other spatial scales and validate our results with
   European-scale status assessments for coastal waters. Uncertainties and
   development points are identified. Still, the results suggest that
   Europe's seas are widely disturbed, indicating potential discrepancy
   between ambitions for Blue Growth and the objective of achieving good
   environmental status within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Title = {Stream power index for networks (SPIN) toolbox for decision support in
   urbanizing watersheds},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urbanization typically leads to erosion and instability in rivers, and
   many management and restoration strategies have been developed to dampen
   the worst impacts. Stream power, defined as the rate of energy
   expenditure in a river, is a promising metric for analyzing cumulative
   effects. In this paper we describe a spatial decision support system
   called the Stream Power Index for Networks (SPIN) toolbox that can be
   used to assess urban river stability at a watershed scale. The
   objectives of the paper are to: a) describe the toolbox algorithms and
   procedures and b) demonstrate the utility of the approach. SPIN is
   written in Python and packaged as an ArcGIS toolbox. The toolbox
   combines existing landscape analysis algorithms with new algorithms to
   model river confluences, channel sinuosity, and threshold sediment
   particle sizes. Data can also be ingested from a standard hydraulic
   model. Two case studies demonstrate use of the toolbox to: i) anticipate
   current morphology; ii) predict urban morphologic change; and iii)
   analyze the benefits for stormwater management and channel restoration
   scenarios on channel stability.},

Abstract = {Developing conservation strategies to mitigate cumulative impacts
   requires the understanding of historic land use and land cover changes
   at the regional scale. By using a multisensory and multitemporal
   approach, we identified the major changes driving cumulative impacts on
   native vegetation in northeastern Amazon. Comparing two regions, one
   with mining as the key driver and another where mining is associated
   with other industrial activities (cellulose), we explore the land use
   and land cover historic dynamics and derive implications for the
   assessment of cumulative impacts. Transitions of forest cover to
   pastureland, silviculture, and urban expansion were mapped in detail
   over a 20-year period, revealing that silviculture growth cleared more
   forests than pastureland expansion when associated with pulp mill
   activities and kaolin mining. In contrast, in a region with gold and
   iron mining, pastureland expansion was more relevant, clearing mainly
   areas surrounding new roads. This research shows that the interplay of
   major mining and industrial investments can produce cumulative losses of
   native vegetation, depending on the associated industries and
   infrastructure required for the project development. Our findings
   emphasize that the definition of spatial and temporal boundaries for the
   assessment of cumulative impacts must consider different trends in
   impact accumulation and changes in their spatial distribution over time.},

Abstract = {The Alberta oil sands industry and the New South Wales coal industry
   both faced controversies related to their cumulative impacts. In an
   attempt to generate hypotheses, we compared their attempts to maintain
   legitimacy, in its various aspects, for both their industries and the
   regulatory regimes that evolved as the controversies persisted. Both the
   existing literature and the two cases suggest that greater use of
   multi-sectoral stakeholder forums for the governance of cumulative
   impacts can bolster the legitimacy of both the industry and its
   regulatory regime, including those aspects handled through
   self-regulation. The cases suggested the additional hypotheses that (a)
   the importance of the decisions allocated to the multi-stakeholder
   regulatory forum affects legitimacy perceptions generally, and (b) the
   multi-stakeholder approach to regulation does little to bolster
   legitimacy when stakeholders include activists who are more interested
   in transnational issues than local cumulative impacts. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Cumulative impact assessment of hazardous ionic liquids towards aquatic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {415},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {In the present research work, a comprehensive tool for cumulative
   ecotoxicological impact assessment of ionic liquids (ILs) to aquatic
   life has been constructed. Using the probabilistic tool, impact of
   individual ILs to a group of aquatic species is assessed by chemical
   toxicity distributions (CTDs). The impact of group of ILs to individual
   aquatic species is assessed by species sensitivity distributions (SSDs).
   Acute toxicity data of imidazolium ILs with chloride (Cl- ), bromide
   (Br- ), tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) anions
   are used in CTD and SSD. Allowable concentrations for a group of
   Imidazolium ILs with the same mode of action (SMOA) to five aquatic
   species; Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri, Algae, Zebrafish, and
   Escherichia coli are estimated by CTDs. It has been concluded that
   1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) possess the lowest risk at
   an acceptable risk value of 750 x 10-5 mmol/L which is 12\% less than
   that of OMIMCl. Furthermore, the sensitivities towards the aquatic
   species reveal that from the studied ILs, BMIMBF4 with an acceptable
   risk value of 3200 x 10-5 mmol/L is the most suitable IL towards the
   selected aquatic species. Hence, current work provides cumulative
   allowable concentrations and acceptable risk values for ILs which
   release to aquatic compartment of ecosystem.},

Title = {A quantitative approach on environment-food nexus: integrated modeling
   and indices for cumulative impact assessment of farm management
   practices},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Background: Best management practices (BMPs) are promising solutions
   that can partially control pollution discharged from farmlands. These
   strategies, like fertilizer reduction and using filter strips, mainly
   control nutrient (N and P) pollution loads in basins. However, they have
   secondary impacts on nutrition production and ecosystem. This study
   develops a method to evaluate the cumulative environmental impacts of
   BMPs. It also introduces and calculates food's environmental footprint
   (FEF) for accounting the total environmental damages per nutrition
   production. Methods: This study combines the soil and water assessment
   tool (SWAT) for basin simulation with the indices of ReCiPe, a life
   cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. By these means, the effectiveness
   of BMPs on pollution loads, production yields, and water footprints
   (WFs) are evaluated and converted as equivalent environmental damages.
   This method was verified in Zrebar Lake, western Iran. Here, water
   consumption, as WFs, and eutrophication are the main indices that are
   converted into equivalent health and ecological impairments. Two
   methods, entropy and environmental performance index (EPI), are used for
   weighting normalized endpoints in last step. Results: Results showed
   that using 25-50\% less fertilizer and water for irrigation combined
   with vegetated filter strips reduce N and P pollution about 34-60\% and
   8-21\%, respectively. These can decrease ecosystem damages by 5-9\% and
   health risks by 7-14\%. Here, freshwater eutrophication is a more
   critical damage in ecosystem. However, using less fertilizer adversely
   reduces total nutrition production by 1.7-3.7\%. It means that BMPs can
   decline total ecological damages and health risks, which threatens
   nutrition production. FEF presents a tool to solve this dilemma about
   the sustainability of BMPs. In the study area, a 4-9\% decrease in FEF
   means that BMPs are more environmental friendly than nutrition menacing.
   Finally, this study concludes that SWAT-ReCiPe with FEF provides a
   quantitative framework for environment-food nexus assessment. However,
   due to the uncertainties, this method is recommended as a tool for
   comparing management strategies instead of reporting certain values.},

Title = {Resolving ecosystem complexity in ecological risk assessment for mine
   site rehabilitation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {319},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Context: Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) are important tools for
   supporting evidence-based decision making. However, most ERA frameworks
   rarely consider complex ecological feedbacks, which limit their capacity
   to evaluate risks at community and ecosystem levels of
   organisation.Method: We used qualitative mathematical modelling to add
   additional perspectives to previously conducted ERAs for the
   rehabilitation of the Ranger uranium mine (Northern Territory,
   Australia) and support an assess-ment of the cumulative risks from the
   mine site. Using expert elicitation workshops, separate qualitative
   models and scenarios were developed for aquatic and terrestrial systems.
   The models developed in the workshops were used to construct Bayes Nets
   that predicted whole-of-ecosystem outcomes after components were
   perturbed.Results: The terrestrial model considered the effect of fire
   and weeds on established native vegetation that will be important for
   the successful rehabilitation of Ranger. It predicted that a combined
   intervention that suppresses both weeds and fire intensity gave similar
   response predictions as for weed control alone, except for lower levels
   of certainty to tall grasses and fire intensity in models with immature
   trees or tall grasses. However, this had ambiguous predictions for short
   grasses and forbs, and tall grasses in models representing mature
   vegetation. The aquatic model considered the effects of magnesium (Mg),
   a key solute in current and predicted mine runoff and groundwater
   egress, which is known to adversely affect many aquatic species. The
   aquatic models provided support that attached algae and phytoplankton
   assemblages are the key trophic base for food webs. It predicted that
   shifts in phytoplankton abundance arising from increase in Mg to
   receiving waters, may result in cascading effects through the
   food-chain.Conclusion: The qualitative modelling approach was flexible
   and capable of modelling both gradual (i.e. decadal) processes in the
   mine-site restoration and the comparatively more rapid (seasonal)
   processes of the aquatic ecosystem. The modelling also provides a useful
   decision tool for identifying important ecosystem sub-systems for
   further research efforts.},

Title = {A multi-pressure analysis of ecosystem services for conservation
   planning in the Alps},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic pressures such as pollution, climate change or
   invasive species can have multiple impacts on ecosystems and the
   services (ES) they provide. To address the potential effects on ES
   provision, we propose a geospatial framework to identify and analyze the
   cumulative effects on terrestrial and freshwater ES. The framework
   includs an impact chain analysis based on ten pressures grouped into six
   categories (pollution, climate change, land-use change,
   overexploitation, land fragmentation, invasive species) and their single
   or multiple effects on five key ES of the Alpine environment
   (recreation, forest protection, CO2 sequestration, habitat maintenance,
   grassland biomass). Results show that the areas most affected by
   cumulative effects were located in major urban centers, in the Po
   Valley, Germany, Slovenia, and in coastal areas of the Adriatic Sea. The
   spatial coincidence analysis of pressure P-ES on IUCN protected sites
   showed that protection categories IV and V mostly had high P/high ES
   scores. Our approach will help in management and planning for mountain
   conservation aimed at reducing multi-pressure occurrences in
   transboundary environments. The framework can be used to identify areas
   with the highest ES provision, characterize areas with high stress from
   anthropogenic pressures, and examine the effects of pressures on
   protected areas.},

Abstract = {Incorporating ecosystem changes from non-indigenous species (NIS) is an
   important task of maritime spatial planning. Maritime spatial planning
   requires a framework that emphasises ecological functioning in a state
   of dynamic change, including changes to ecosystem services from
   functions introduced by new NIS. Adaptable modelling toolsets should be
   developed that can readily incorporate knowledge of new NIS. In the
   Baltic Sea, recent NIS examples are the North American mud crab
   Rhithropanopeus harrisii and the Ponto-Caspian round goby Neogobius
   melanostomus. We performed environmental niche modelling that predicted
   N. melanostomus will spread across large areas of the Baltic Sea coast
   while R. harrisii will be limited to regions with high temperature and
   low salinity conditions. We then performed a meta-analysis on literature
   showing effects in the Baltic Sea from these NIS and calculated the
   standardised effect-sizes on relevant ecosystem services. Half the
   impacts identified for N. melanostomus were considered to increase
   ecosystem service outcomes, while all R. harrisii impacts caused
   apparent decreases. Effect coefficients were incorporated into an online
   impact assessment tool developed by the Estonian Marine Institute. Users
   with or without science training can use the portal to estimate areas
   impacted and changes to natural assets (km(2)) caused by these NIS and
   cumulative effects from other pressure-types. Impact estimates are based
   on best available knowledge from manipulative and correlative
   experiments and thus form a link between science and management. Dynamic
   modelling techniques informed from varied ecological and methodological
   perspectives will effectively advise spatial planners about rapid
   maritime changes and mitigation actions to reduce NIS impacts especially
   in the focus areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pregnant women are widely exposed to phthalic acid esters (PAEs) that
   are commonly used in most aspects of modern life. However, few studies
   have examined the cumulative exposure of pregnant women to a variety of
   PAEs derived from the living environmental conditions in China.
   Therefore, this study aimed to determine the urinary concentrations of
   nine PAE metabolites in pregnant women, examine the relationship between
   urinary concentrations and residential characteristics, and conduct a
   risk assessment analysis. We included 1,888 women who were in their
   third trimester of pregnancy, and we determined their urinary
   concentrations of nine PAE metabolites using high-performance gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The risk assessment of exposure to
   PAEs was calculated based on the estimated daily intake. A linear
   regression model was used to analyze the relationship between
   creatinine-adjusted PAE metabolite concentrations and residential
   characteristics. The detection rate of five PAE metabolites in the study
   population was > 90\%. Among the PAE metabolites adjusted by creatinine,
   the urinary metabolite concentration of monobutyl phthalate was found to
   be the highest. Residential factors, such as housing type, proximity to
   streets, recent decorations, lack of ventilation in the kitchen, less
   than equal to three rooms, and the use of coal/kerosene/wood/wheat straw
   fuels, were all significantly associated with high PAE metabolite
   concentrations. Due to PAE exposure, similar to 42\% (n = 793) of the
   participants faced potential health risks, particularly attributed to
   dibutyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, and di(2-ethyl)hexyl phthalate
   exposure. Living in buildings and using coal/kerosene/wood/wheat straw
   as domestic fuel can further increase the risks.},

Title = {Human exposure to phthalate esters associated with e-waste dismantling:
   Exposure levels, sources, and risk assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs) can be released into the environment during the
   dismantling of electronic waste (ewaste), but urinary levels of PAE
   metabolites (mPAEs) in humans living in e-waste sites have not been
   documented. In this study, 11 mPAEs were determined in urine samples
   collected from participants living in e-waste dismantling sites and a
   reference area in Southern China. The total urinary concentrations of
   the 11 mPAEs (SmPAEs) in the e-waste sites (range: 11.1 ng/mL to 3380
   ng/mL) were dominated by mono-(2-isobutyl) phthalate and mono-n-butyl
   phthalate. Participants living in the e-waste sites had significantly
   higher (p < 0.05) urinary concentrations of Sigma mPAEs (and 5
   individual mPAEs) than those in the reference area. Hence, e-waste
   dismantling activities contributed to human exposure to PAEs. The
   exposure doses of di-n-butyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,
   di-iso-butyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, and diethyl phthalate were
   3.41, 3.04, 1.37, 0.25, and 0.20 mu g/kg bw/day, respectively.
   Furthermore, the health risk assessment in terms of hazard quotient and
   hazard index showed that approximately 22\% of the participants living
   in the e-waste sites had HI values exceeding 1; importantly, 68\% of
   them were non-adults (i.e., 0-18 years old). In the e-waste sites, 8 of
   the 11 mPAEs in urine samples had significantly positively associations
   (r= 0.185-0.358, p < 0.05) with the urinary concentration of
   8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a marker of DNA oxidative stress.
   Therefore, people living in e-waste dismantling areas may have a
   potential health risk caused by PAE exposure. To the best of our
   knowledge, this study is the first to measure urinary mPAE levels in
   people living in e-waste dismantling areas.},

Title = {Cumulative stressors reduce the self-regulating capacity of coastal
   ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are prone to tipping points, particularly in coastal
   zones where dramatic changes are associated with interactions between
   cumulative stressors (e.g., shellfish harvesting, eutrophication and
   sediment inputs) and ecosystem functions. A common feature of many
   degraded estuaries is elevated turbidity that reduces incident light to
   the seafloor, resulting from multiple factors including changes in
   sediment loading, sea-level rise and increased water column algal
   biomass. To determine whether cumulative effects of elevated turbidity
   may result in marked changes in the interactions between ecosystem
   components driving nutrient processing, we conducted a large-scale
   experiment manipulating sediment nitrogen concentrations in 15 estuaries
   across a national-scale gradient in incident light at the seafloor. We
   identified a threshold in incident light that was related to distinct
   changes in the ecosystem interaction networks (EIN) that drive nutrient
   processing. Above this threshold, network connectivity was high with
   clear mechanistic links to denitrification and the role of large
   shellfish in nitrogen processing. The EIN analyses revealed interacting
   stressors resulting in a decoupling of ecosystem processes in turbid
   estuaries with a lower capacity to denitrify and process nitrogen. This
   suggests that, as turbidity increases with sediment load, coastal areas
   can be more vulnerable to eutrophication. The identified interactions
   between light, nutrient processing and the abundance of large shellfish
   emphasizes the importance of actions that seek to manage multiple
   stressors and conserve or enhance shellfish abundance, rather than
   actions focusing on limiting a single stressor.},

Title = {Identifying conservation priority areas to inform maritime spatial
   planning: A new approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {639},
Pages = {1088-1098},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Accommodating sea uses while protecting the ecosystems is a challenge of
   the marine planning and management process. The European Directive on
   Maritime Spatial Planning calls for Maritime Spatial Plans until 2021
   developed within an Ecosystem Based Management approach. The main goal
   of this study is to support the Maritime Spatial Planning process with
   ecological meaningful information, namely identifying priority areas for
   conservation that are facing less anthropogenic impacts. We developed a
   new approach for selection of high priority areas for conservation using
   Marxan software and Cumulative Impacts decision support tools. We
   identified four main areas prone to conservation in Portuguese mainland
   subdivision, namely the areas of Figueira da Foz/Peniche, south Cabo
   Espichel/Sines, Cabo Sarclao/Faro and Lagos/Faro. The outputs from this
   study show the valuable input when allocating space to activities and
   uses in the marine realm supporting the planning process in the
   development of management alternatives. This case study also illustrates
   how ecological goals can be better included to contribute to the
   Maritime Planning process in Portugal. Systematic planning can be
   applied to support the connection between Marine Strategy Framework and
   Maritime Spatial Planning European Directives. This is highly relevant
   in the time being for Portugal, as the 2nd cycles of both directives are
   ongoing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Methodology and Tool for Mapping the Risk of Cumulative Effects on
   Benthic Habitats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {The implementation of the European integrated marine policy poses many
   scientific challenges. Among them, the knowledge and understanding of
   interactions between anthropogenic pressures and ecological components
   is an important issue, particularly to help define Good Environmental
   Status, environmental targets and monitoring programs of the Marine
   Strategy Framework Directive (2008, MSFD). Assessment of cumulative
   effects of different pressures is a particularly complex issue requiring
   modeling tools and methods, as well as accurate data sets on human
   activities, anthropogenic pressures and ecological components. The
   results of these assessments are also uncertain and highly dependent on
   the calculation methods and assumptions, as well as on the data sets
   used. Within this context, we developed a technical and methodological
   approach to map the risk of cumulative effects of different pressures on
   benthic habitats. These developments were initiated as part of the
   implementation of the MSFD in France to contribute to the diagnosis of
   the marine environment. Here we provide a demonstrator to illustrate the
   feasibility for mapping the risk of cumulative effects of different
   pressures on benthic habitats, as well as the confidence index and the
   variability associated with this analysis. The method is based on a
   spatial analysis using a mapping of benthic habitats and their
   sensitivity to pressures, as well as the distribution and intensity of
   human activities and associated pressures. We collected and prepared
   relatively accurate and consistent data sets to describe human
   activities and benthic habitats. Data sets are embedded into a grid that
   facilitates the management and analysis of the data and exploitation of
   the results. The demonstrator consists of a relational database using
   the Spatial Query Language (SQL) language as well as data analysis
   scripts using the R language. The first demonstrator operations
   validated the main methodological and technical choices and helped to
   identify future developments needed to facilitate the appropriation and
   integration of these approaches in the implementation of public policies
   for the management of the marine environment.},

Title = {Cumulative health risk assessment of 17 perfluoroalkylated and
   polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in the Swedish population},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {112-123},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Humans are simultaneously exposed to a multitude of chemicals. Human
   health risk assessment of chemicals is, however, normally performed on
   single substances, which may underestimate the total risk, thus bringing
   a need for reliable methods to assess the risk of combined exposure to
   multiple chemicals. Per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) is a
   large group of chemicals that has emerged as global environmental
   contaminants. In the Swedish population, 17 PFASs have been measured, of
   which the vast majority lacks human health risk assessment information.
   The objective of this study was to for the first time perform a
   cumulative health risk assessment of the 17 PFASs measured in the
   Swedish population, individually and in combination, using the Hazard
   Index (HI) approach. Swedish biomonitoring data (blood/serum
   concentrations of PFASs) were used and two study populations identified:
   1) the general population exposed indirectly via the environment and 2)
   occupationally exposed professional ski waxers. Hazard data used were
   publicly available toxicity data for hepatotoxicity and reproductive
   toxicity as well as other more sensitive toxic effects. The results
   showed that PFASs concentrations were in the low ng/ml serum range in
   the general population, reaching high ng/ml and low mu g/ml serum
   concentrations in the occupationally exposed. For those congeners
   lacking toxicity data with regard to hepatotoxicity and reproductive
   toxicity read-across extrapolations was performed. Other effects at
   lower dose levels were observed for some well-studied congeners. The
   risk characterization showed no concern for hepatotoxicity or
   reproductive toxicity in the general population except in a
   subpopulation eating PFOS-contaminated fish, illustrating that high
   local exposure may be of concern. For the occupationally exposed there
   was concern for hepatotoxicity by PFOA and all congeners in combination
   as well as for reproductive toxicity by all congeners in combination,
   thus a need for reduced exposure was identified. Concern for
   immunotoxicity by PFOS and for disrupted mammary gland development by
   PFOA was identified in both study populations as well as a need of
   additional toxicological data for many PFAS congeners with respect to
   all assessed endpoints. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Human pressure on the environment is expanding and intensifying,
   especially in coastal and offshore areas. Major contributors to this are
   the current push for offshore renewable energy sources, which are
   thought of as environmentally friendly sources of power, as well as the
   continued demand for petroleum. Human disturbances, including the noise
   almost ubiquitously associated with human activity, are likely to
   increase the incidence, magnitude, and duration of adverse effects on
   marine life, including stress responses. Stress responses have the
   potential to induce fitness consequences for individuals, which add to
   more obvious directed takes (e.g., hunting or fishing) to increase the
   overall population-level impact. To meet the requirements of marine
   spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, many efforts are
   ongoing to quantify the cumulative impacts of all human actions on
   marine species or populations. Meanwhile, regulators face the challenge
   of managing these accumulating and interacting impacts with limited
   scientific guidance. We believe there is scientific support for capping
   the level of impact for (at a minimum) populations in decline or with
   unknown statuses. This cap on impact can be facilitated through
   implementation of regular application cycles for project authorization
   or improved programmatic and aggregated impact assessments that
   simultaneously consider multiple projects. Cross-company collaborations
   and a better incorporation of uncertainty into decision making could
   also help limit, if not reduce, cumulative impacts of multiple human
   activities. These simple management steps may also form the basis of a
   rudimentary form of marine spatial planning and could be used in support
   of future ecosystem-based management efforts.},

Title = {Integrating hydrological connectivity and zooplankton composition in
   Arctic ponds and lakes},
Journal = {FRESHWATER BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2131-2150},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arctic landscapes are characterised by their numerous ponds and lakes.
   With increased climate warming and consequent changes in hydrological
   connectivity, the ecology of many of these waterbodies is expected to
   change.We sampled 13 ponds and 22 lakes for zooplankton and various
   limnological and physical environmental variables in the vicinity of
   Cambridge Bay, Nunavut (69.1169 \& DEG; N, 105.0597 \& DEG; W), with the
   aim of testing how well the degree of hydrological connectivity
   explained patterns in species composition and abundance and contributed
   to crustacean production. Ponds were hydrologically isolated while the
   lakes were arranged in four lake chains and ranged from the headwaters
   to highly inter-connected lakes receiving water from one to 768 upstream
   lakes.In all sites combined, 77 zooplankton species were found,
   including 56 rotifers, six copepods, 11 cladocerans, two fairy shrimp
   species, a mysid, and a tadpole shrimp. We show that the zooplankton
   communities differed between hydrologically isolated (ponds) and
   connected (lakes) systems, with 17 species unique to ponds and 20 to
   lakes. Furthermore, the communities were more similar within lake chains
   and hence in lakes closer to each other. In ponds, distances between
   waterbodies had no impact on community similarity.Zooplankton abundance
   was higher in lakes (255 ind/L) than in ponds (65 ind/L) due to the
   higher number of rotifers that accounted for nearly 80\% of the
   zooplankton abundance in lakes. In ponds, rotifers, cladocerans, and
   copepods were equally abundant. In terms of biomass, cladocerans
   represented 65\% of total biomass in all waterbodies except for a chain
   of deep lakes that had abundant fish communities. In these lakes,
   cladoceran abundance and biomass were low and probably limited by fish
   predation.Zooplankton production was higher in ponds (4.6 mgC m-3 day-1)
   than in lakes (1.7 mgC m-3 day-1), and within lakes was lowest in the
   chain composed of large lakes (1.3 mgC m-3 day-1). The high production
   in ponds was closely linked to high zooplankton biomass and further
   explained by high gross primary production supported by relatively high
   nutrient concentrations in these shallow systems.Our study emphasises
   that hydrological connectivity is key to shaping zooplankton
   communities, although fish presence also appears to affect them. It
   shows that isolated ponds (that currently account for c83\% of all
   waterbodies on southern Victoria Island) are hotspots of aquatic
   biological productivity that probably play an essential role in Arctic
   freshwater landscapes. Finally, our study provides critical baseline
   information on the current composition of Arctic zooplankton communities
   important for estimating climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {Population endangerment typically arises from multiple, potentially
   interacting anthropogenic stressors. Extensive research has investigated
   the consequences of multiple stressors on organisms, frequently focusing
   on individual life stages. Less is known about population-level
   consequences of exposure to multiple stressors, especially when exposure
   varies through life. We provide the first theoretical basis for
   identifying species at risk of magnified effects from multiple stressors
   across life history. By applying a population modeling framework, we
   reveal conditions under which population responses from stressors
   applied to distinct life stages are either magnified (synergistic) or
   mitigated. We find that magnification or mitigation critically depends
   on the shape of density dependence, but not the life stage in which it
   occurs. Stressors are always magnified when density dependence is linear
   or concave, and magnified or mitigated when it is convex. Using Bayesian
   numerical methods, we estimated the shape of density dependence for
   eight species across diverse taxa, finding support for all three shapes.},

Abstract = {The development of mineral and energy resources worldwide has placed
   pressure on regional environments, economies and communities. The
   cumulative impacts, or cumulative effects, arising from overlapping
   development have stretched political systems that have traditionally

   developments, presenting challenges for policy makers, resource
   developers and civil society actors. An equally challenging task has
   been realisation of the potential development dividends of mineral and
   energy resources in the areas of business development, infrastructure,
   human development or the management of resource revenues. This paper
   introduces a special issue on `Understanding and Managing Cumulative
   Impacts in Resource Regions'. The special issue interrogates the
   effectiveness of new and traditional policy responses, explores methods
   and strategies to better respond to cumulative impacts, and details
   practical examples of collaborative and coordinated approaches. Papers
   cover a range of environmental, economic and social issues, geographical

   introduces the cumulative impact issues that have manifest in resource
   regions, critically appraises current conceptions of cumulative impacts,
   and details management and policy responses to address the cumulative
   dimensions of impact. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The decline in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations
   in Alberta lead to classification as a threatened species. Rapid
   industrial development continues to affect caribou habitat. Natural and
   anthropogenic factors, which affect population dynamics, act
   cumulatively. We developed an interactive cumulative effects model,
   which could be used to assess both natural and anthropogenic factors
   influencing survival of caribou. This model is based on functional and
   numerical responses of carnivores (wolves (Canis lupus)), herbivores
   (caribou and moose (Alces alces)) and resources (lichen and vascular
   plants). It includes stochasticity in some elements and is aspatial (but
   divides habitat into categories depending on habitat type and age).
   Based on simulation experiments, we suggest that the most detrimental
   factor on caribou population dynamics is the functional loss of habitat
   due to avoidance of good quality habitat in proximity of industrial
   infrastructures. We argue that in the natural boreal ecosystem, habitat
   was not limiting caribou in northern Alberta, and caribou could coexist
   with uncontrolled wolf populations that kept caribou at low densities of
   about 0.1 km(-2). We argue that wolf control is not a practical solution
   in caribou conservation and propose different alternatives. We also
   suggest potential thresholds for industrial development for specific
   interactions of different predation pressures and habitat carrying
   capacity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Characterization of ecotoxicological risks from unintentional mixture
   exposures calculated from European freshwater monitoring data:
   Forwarding prospective chemical risk management},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {822},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {Current regulatory chemical safety assessments do not acknowledge that
   ambient exposures are to multiple chemicals at the same time. As a
   result, potentially harmful exposures to unintentional mixtures may
   occur, leading to potential insufficient protection of the environment.
   The present study describes cumulative environmental risk assessment
   results for European fresh water ecosystems, based on the NORMAN
   chemical surface water monitoring database (1998-2016). It aims to
   characterize the magnitude of the mixture problem and the relative
   contribution of chemicals to the mixture risk, and evaluates how
   cumulative risks reduce when the acceptable risk per single chemical is
   fractionally lowered. Available monitoring data were curated and
   aggregated to 26,631 place-time combinations with at least two
   chemicals, of which 376 place-time combinations had at least 25
   chemicals identified above the Limit of Detection. Various risk metrics
   were based on measured environmental concentrations (MECs). Mixture risk
   characterization ratio's (Sigma RCRs) >= 1 were found for 39\% of the
   place-time combinations, with few chemicals dominating the SRCR.
   Analyses of mixture toxic pressures, expressed as multi-substance
   Potentially Affected Fractions of species based on No Observed Effect
   Concentrations (msPAF(NOEC)), showed similar outcomes. Small fractional
   reductions of the ambient chemical concentrations give a steep increase
   of the percentage of sufficiently protected water bodies (i.e. Sigma RCR
   < 1 and msPAF(NOEC) < 5\%). Scientific and regulatory aspects of these
   results are discussed, especially with reference to the
   representativeness of the monitoring data for characterizing ambient
   mixtures, the robustness of the findings, and the possible regulatory
   implementation of the concept of a Mixture Allocation Factor (MAF) for
   prospective chemicals risk management. Although the monitoring data do
   not represent the full spectrum of ambient mixture exposures in Europe,
   results show the need for adapting policies to reach European Union
   goals for a toxic-free environment and underpin the utility and possible
   magnitude of a MAF.},

Title = {Not so Black and White: environmental justice and cumulative impact
   assessments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {667-694},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {A growing number of scientific studies in recent years have investigated
   disparate exposure to ecological hazards in American society. Working
   from an environmental justice perspective, this body of research
   consistently reveals that poor communities of color are most likely to
   bear a disproportionate burden of negative externalities. These studies
   utilize a wide range of research methodologies, including various
   indicators of ecological hazards (e.g., proximity to waste sites,
   industrial emissions, ambient air quality), but few, if any, utilize
   composite measures to approximate cumulative environmental impact.
   Consequently, the environmental justice (EJ) literature is characterized
   by a failure to effectively measure overall impact from an extensive
   range of ecological hazards. Limitations on available data make this a
   serious problem for present and future studies. We argue that cumulative
   measures of environmental impact can play an important role in
   furthering our understanding of environmental injustices in the United
   States. In this study of Massachusetts, we develop and implement such a
   cumulative measure of negative environmental impacts. By controlling for
   the density and severity of ecological hazardous sites and facilities
   within every community in the state, we demonstrate that exposure
   patterns take a generally linear distribution when analyzed by race and
   class. So, while our results reaffirm previous findings that low-income
   communities and communities of color bear significantly greater
   ecological burdens than predominantly White and more affluent
   communities, our findings also suggest that environmental injustices
   exist on a remarkably consistent continuum for nearly all communities.
   In other words, as the minority population and lower-income composition
   of a community increases, correspondingly, so does cumulative exposure
   to environmental hazards. In this respect, communities which are more
   racially mixed and of moderate income status that are not typically
   identified as meeting EJ criteria (in demographic terms) also face more
   significant ecological hazards. Thus, the strict bifurcation of
   communities into categories of Enviromnental Justice and
   Non-Environmental Justice is problematic, and poses a serious dilemma
   for policy makers, public health officials, and community activists. To
   overcome this challenge requires the adoption of a cumulative
   environmental justice impact assessment (CERA), which in addition to the
   demographic characteristics of a community, also takes into account the
   total environmental burden and related health impacts upon residents.
   Furthermore, through the adoption of the precautionary principle, source
   reduction, and alternative forms of ``cleaner{''} production,
   environmental justice advocates must work for policies which reduce the
   environmental threat for the full range of communities, as well as their
   own. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a holistic way to manage the marine
   environment, involving partnerships between people and the recognition
   of ecological complexity. As we progress towards EBM, risk assessments
   must move beyond an evaluation of the direct impacts of a single
   stressor on a species or habitat. Here, we propose 12 risk assessment
   criteria that explicitly reflect the principles of EBM. These criteria
   include the need to assess risk to multiple ecosystem components and
   values, evaluate place and time-specific ecological complexity, evaluate
   recovery, accommodate different knowledge types and communicate
   uncertainty. Contemporary risk assessment approaches rarely meet all 12
   criteria and whilst many approaches could be adapted to do so, some are
   more easily modified than others. Risk assessment approaches that meet
   our criteria have the greatest potential to support decision-making in
   an EBM context and thereby safeguard our marine environments and their
   values for future generations.},

Abstract = {The social and environmental impacts of rapidly expanding coal and gas
   industries have generated high levels of public concern and there is
   increasing evidence of cumulative impacts. In the Bowen Basin of
   Queensland (Australia) water quality issues have triggered a
   collaborative response to coordinate monitoring efforts, integrate data
   and information and undertake regional analysis to inform
   landscape-scale management. Collaborative governance is promoted as a
   response to complex environmental problems, such as cumulative impacts.
   However, application of this approach to the resources and energy
   sectors remains a significant research gap. This paper reports the
   results of action research in the 2 years taken to negotiate the
   establishment of collaborative governance arrangements to address
   mine-water discharge impacts in the Bowen Basin. The long establishment
   phase has been required to refine objectives, build trust, develop
   governance mechanisms and secure resourcing commitments. The partnership
   established involves more than 20 organisations including regulators,
   resources and energy companies, agricultural industries and research
   organisations. The breadth of participating sectors is a significant
   innovation, but also represents a major challenge in establishing this
   model of regional environmental governance. Promising strategies adopted
   to manage these tensions have included neutral brokerage, facilitative
   leadership, establishing legitimacy of the collaboration and credibility
   of its reports. The case study provides a cautionary tale of the pursuit
   of the promise of `everyone working together' to address cumulative
   impacts. Policy implications include the need for extended commitment
   and integration of collaborative and other responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated that nonchemical stressors may alter
   the toxicity from chemical exposures. This may have public health
   implications for low socioeconomic status (SES) communities that may be
   disproportionately exposed to toxic chemicals and various types of
   community and personal stressors. Nonchemical stressors may introduce an
   important source of variability that needs to be considered by risk
   assessors. Herein, we propose a framework for determining if a
   chemical-nonchemical interaction exists and, if so, options for
   incorporating interaction information into risk assessments. We use the
   increasingly recognized interaction between lead and psychosocial stress
   to illustrate the framework. We found that lead exposure occurs
   disproportionately in low SES groups that also tend to face high levels
   of psychosocial stress; that stress and lead both affect
   neurodevelopment and that this occurs via similar pathways involving the
   hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Further, several epidemiological and
   experimental studies have provided evidence for an interaction between
   lead and psychosocial stress. The implications of this interaction for
   risk assessment are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador is an artisanal and small-scale gold mining
   (ASGM) region with approximately 6000 gold miners working with mercury
   and cyanide. Although artisanal gold mining (AGM) has taken place in
   Portovelo-Zaruma for centuries, highly mechanized small-scale gold
   mining (SGM) processing plants capable of increased throughput began
   being built in the 1990s. While there are benefits associated with ASGM,
   there are also negative impacts experienced by the miners and the
   surrounding communities. To take advantage of ASGM as a
   poverty-alleviating mechanism while reducing unwanted externalities, the
   cumulative impacts must be understood. Numerous challenges to measuring,
   monitoring, and addressing ASGM impacts result from the complexity of
   the impacts themselves, the nature of the gold mining as an informal
   industry, and the shortfalls in the current regulatory framework. These
   are discussed in the context of ongoing, unresolved issues including
   efforts to address trans-boundary water pollution, management of mining
   waste, and conflicts regarding priorities, ambiguities, and enforcement
   of existing regulations and policies. Internationally, interventions to
   address both AGM and SGM impacts have typically focused almost
   exclusively on technological changes through the elimination of mercury
   use. Our analysis suggests that to better address ASGM and their
   cumulative impacts in Ecuador, it will be beneficial to revisit the

   information-based strategies including educational outreach programs and

   The success of these strategies to reduce ASGM-related cumulative
   impacts will depend on sufficient funding and the commitment of

Title = {A synoptic approach for assessing cumulative impacts to wetlands},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {457-475},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency's Wetlands Research Program has
   developed the synoptic approach as a proposed method for assessing
   cumulative impacts to wetlands by providing both a general and a
   comprehensive view of the environment. It can also be applied more
   broadly to regional prioritization of environmental issues. The synoptic
   approach is a framework for making comparisons between landscape
   subunits, such as watersheds, ecoregions, or counties, thereby allowing
   cumulative impacts to be considered in management decisions, Because
   there is a lack of tools that can be used to address cumulative impacts
   within regulatory constraints, the synoptic approach was designed as a
   method that could make use of available information and best
   professional judgement. Thus, the approach is a compromise between the
   need for rigorous results and the need for timely information, It is
   appropriate for decision making when quantitative, accurate information
   is not available; the;cost of improving existing information or
   obtaining better information is high; the cost of a wrong answer is low,
   there is a high demand for the information; and the situation calls for
   setting priorities between multiple decisions versus optimizing for a
   single decision. The synoptic approach should be useful for resource
   managers because an assessment is timely, it can be completed within one
   to two years at relatively low cost, tested, and improved over time. An
   assessment can also be customized to specific needs, and the results are
   presented in mapped format. However, the utility of a synoptic
   assessment depends on how well knowledge of the environment is
   incorporated into the assessment, relevant to particular management
   questions.},

Title = {Using the multiple capitals framework to connect indicators of regional
   cumulative impacts of mining and pastoralism in the Murray Darling
   Basin, Australia},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {733-744},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is commonly recognized that there are constraints to successful
   regional-scale assessment and monitoring of cumulative impacts because
   of challenges in the selection of coherent and measurable indicators of
   the effects. It has also been sensibly declared that the connections
   between components in a region are as important as the state of the
   elements themselves. These have previously been termed ``linked{''}
   cumulative impacts/effects. These connections can be difficult to
   discern because of a complicated set of interactions and unexpected
   linkages. In this paper we diagnose that a significant cause of these
   constraints is the selection of indicators without due regard for their
   inter-relationships in the formulation of the indicator set. The paper
   examines whether the common ``forms of capital{''}, i.e., natural
   (renewable and non-renewable), manufactured, social, human and financial
   capitals, framework is a potential organizing structure. We examine a
   large region in western NSW Australia where the predominant production
   systems are mining and grazing for production of wool, beef and lamb.
   Production in both is driven by consumption of a non-renewable resource,
   i.e., ore for mining and topsoil for grazing, the latter on the basis
   that loss rate estimates far exceed soil formation rates. We propose
   that the challenge of identifying connections of components within and
   between capital stores can be approached by explicitly separating stores
   of capital and the flows of capital between stores and between elements
   within stores, so-called capital fluxes. We attempt to acquire data from
   public sources for both capital stores and fluxes. The question of
   whether these data are a sufficient base for regional assessment, with
   particular reference to connections, is discussed. The well-described
   challenge of a comparative common currency for stores and fluxes is also
   discussed. We conclude that the data acquisition is relatively
   successful for stores and fluxes. A number of linked impacts are
   identified and discussed. The potential use of money as the common
   currency for stores and fluxes of capital is considered. The basic
   proposition is that replacement or preservation costs be used for this.
   We conclude that the study is sufficiently positive to consider further
   research in fully-coupled models of capital stores and fluxes. Crown

Title = {Scoping an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment for the southern Benguela:
   fisheries still biggest risk},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 24},
Abstract = {The southern Benguela ecosystem faces complex pressures from
   anthropogenic activities and climate change, leading to structural and
   functional changes. To counter ecosystem service losses,
   intergovernmental marine science organizations propose integrated
   management. However, predictions to evaluate alternative strategies are
   challenging due to multifaceted sector interactions affecting ecological
   components. Scoping phases of Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEA),
   such as the Options for Delivering Ecosystem-Based Marine Management
   (ODEMM), identify priority sectors and pressures for management using
   linkage chains and impact risk scores. This study expands a South
   African-wide ODEMM assessment to investigate dependent sectors in the
   southern Benguela. Fishing emerged as the primary sector, exhibiting
   high connectance and impact risk on ecological components.
   Disaggregation of the fishing sector into sub-sectors and over three
   21-year time periods revealed the demersal trawl and mixed species
   inshore trawl sectors to still have the greatest impact despite recent
   mitigation efforts, driven by species extraction, bycatch, and
   `incidental loss'. Research gaps, such as the effects of recreational
   fisheries and underwater noise, were identified and need to be addressed
   to improve future ecosystem assessments. Additionally, the effects of
   climate on long-term, ecosystem-scale variability and change need more
   attention in IEAs and should be incorporated into frameworks such as
   ODEMM.},

Title = {Evaluating the regional cumulative impact of wind farms on birds: how
   can spatially explicit dynamic modelling improve impact assessments and
   monitoring?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1. The Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis is very susceptible to the
   negative effects of wind farms. In northern Portugal, this evidence is
   particularly severe due to the skylark's preference for mountain
   breeding habitats where most wind farms are located. Facing the frequent
   failure of environmental impact assessments (ETA) to evaluate the
   cumulative impacts of wind farms on wildlife, this study aimed to
   develop and test a methodology to quantify local and regional
   consequences on birds, using skylarks as a test species, taking into
   account future predictable environmental changes.
   2. We propose a spatially explicit dynamic approach that combines the
   results from multiple modelling techniques under a common framework to
   assess the local and cumulative regional impacts of wind farms on
   skylark populations. This includes the following: (i) modelling the
   local impact of wind farms (in terms of collision mortality) on the
   skylark population dynamics by developing an index for quantitative
   assessments, (ii) determining the actual and future skylark breeding
   distribution across northern Portugal and (iii) integrating the above
   contributions in an emergent spatially explicit regional representation
   to capture the ecological cumulative consequences as a whole.
   3. The simulations show an increasing average local impact for the
   skylark breeding populations directly affected by wind farms, expressed
   in mean number of collision fatalities per UTM study unit (1 km(2)),
   representing 1.3\% of the local breeders in 2006 and 4\% in 2026.
   4. The distribution area of skylark breeding populations as predicted to
   decrease around 4.5\% throughout a period of 15 years, as a result of
   the scenario of climate and land cover changes in the study area. When
   combined with a concomitant increase in skylark global mortality (c.
   184\%) induced by all wind farms in the study region, the above trend
   contributes to an intensification of the regional cumulative impact from
   1.2\% to 3.7\% of the total estimated breeding individuals.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The proposed modelling framework
   represents a step forward in evaluating the multi-scale cumulative
   consequences of wind farms on vulnerable birds, using skylarks as a test
   species. This could be used in the future to guide monitoring efforts
   and to improve the applicability of the data bases generated by
   long-term ecological research and monitoring studies.},

Title = {Exposure to phthalate esters in Japanese females in Kyoto, Japan from
   1993 to 2016: Temporal trends and associated health risks},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {165},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phthalates are used as plasticizers in many products used in daily life
   worldwide. Due to industrial and economic developments, exposure among
   general population to phthalates may vary geographically and temporally.
   However, studies are lacking for investigating temporal changes in
   phthalate exposure in the Japanese population. In the present study, the
   temporal trends in exposure to various phthalates were assessed among a
   group of Japanese adult female population over 1993-2016 and derived
   associated risks. For this purpose, urine samples of healthy Japanese
   females in Kyoto, Japan (N = 132) collected in 1993, 2000, 2003, 2009,
   2011, and 2016, were employed and measured for the concentrations of 18
   phthalate metabolites. Over this period, the detection rates of
   mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP)
   decreased, and the geometric means of the urinary concentrations of
   mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and
   mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) showed a significant
   decreasing trend. Cumulative risk due to exposure to dibutyl phthalate
   (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and
   di-2ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) showed a dramatic decrease only between
   1993 and 2000. The maximum hazard quotient (HQM) was attributed to DEHP
   in most subjects regardless of sampling year. This study showed the
   temporal trend of the exposure of Japanese females to several phthalate
   esters over two decades. As of the late 2010's, DEHP was still the
   predominant component of phthalate ester exposure in the population. The
   HI value, however, indicates that direct risk due to phthalate exposure
   was unlikely among the studied population.},

   pesticide residues based on the French ELFE cohort. A self-administered
   food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about the last three months of
   pregnancy filled in by pregnant women in 2011 was used in combination
   with occurrence data from French Total Diet Studies completed by the
   results of national monitoring programs on pesticide residues in food.
   The dietary intake of pesticides (mu g/kg of body weight/day) was
   estimated for 14,099 pregnant women with a complete FFQ, for 317
   substances under two occurrence scenarios to handle left-censored data:
   a lower-bound scenario (LB), where undetected results were set to zero,
   and an upper-bound scenario (UB), where undetected results were set to
   the detection limit if the substance was expected to be found in food
   and zero if it was not. The risk was assessed for 284 substances with a
   toxicological reference value (TRV) and a good coverage-level of the
   diet potentially contributing to pesticide intake. The cumulative risk
   was also assessed for seven effects on nervous and thyroid systems using
   the hazard index and the Cumulative Assessment Groups defined by EFSA.
   Substances with the highest exposure levels under the LB scenario were,
   in decreasing order, imazalil, piperonyl butoxide, chlorpropham,
   thiabendazole, iprodione and propargite. Under the LB scenario, only for
   lindane did women have a statistically significant probability of
   exceeding the TRV (2.4\%). Under the UB scenario, risk could not be
   excluded for nine other substances. A better management of left-censored
   data and more sensitive analyses of the main food contributors might
   help to refine the UB exposure and risk assessments. A statistically
   significant cumulative risk was found for neurochemical effects related
   to high intake levels of three organophosphate insecticides
   (chlorpyrifos, pirimiphos-methyl and dimethoate) mainly detected in
   fruits and cereals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cumulative risk analysis of contaminant occurrence in United States
   drinking water for the period of 2010-2017 indicates that over 100,000
   lifetime cancer cases could be due to carcinogenic chemicals in tap
   water. The majority of this risk is due to the presence of arsenic,
   disinfection byproducts and radioactive contaminants. For different
   states within the U.S., cumulative cancer risk for drinking water
   contaminants ranges between 1 x 10(-4) and 1 x 10(-3), similar to the
   range of cumulative cancer risks reported for air pollutants. Overall,
   national attributable risk due to tap water contaminants is
   approximately 4 x 10( -4), which is two orders of magnitude higher than
   the de minimus cancer risk of one-in-a-million. Thus, decreasing the
   levels of chemical contaminants in drinking water represents an
   important opportunity for protecting public health.},

Abstract = {The Black Sea remains one of the most fragile marine systems globally.
   The six countries that share the coastline of this semi-enclosed sea
   have declared, through the Convention on Biological Diversity and
   regional conventions, their intention to conserve biodiversity and
   increase the coverage of the protected areas. However, currently only a
   small proportion of the marine area is under protection. Here, we
   spatially delineated priority conservation sites that could ensure
   species protection under the impact of different threats. We developed a
   cumulative risk index, incorporating anthropogenic pressures related to
   pollution and fisheries. We then combined this information with
   distribution data of marine species to apply a systematic conservation
   planning approach. We identified eleven key areas that cover 10\% of the
   Black Sea, the protection of which could attain realistic conservation
   targets. These sites are mainly located in neritic and coastal habitats,
   which also host a number of species that avoid the anoxic part of the
   ocean basin. The management and efficient protection of these key areas
   require international collaboration, representing the only way to
   alleviate the severe degradation of this sensitive, but valuable, marine

Title = {Assessing corporate project impacts in changeable contexts: A human
   rights perspective},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {47},
Pages = {36-46},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Project-level impact assessment was originally conceived as a snapshot
   taken in advance of project implementation, contrasting current
   conditions with a likely future scenario involving a variety of
   predicted impacts. Current best practice guidance has encouraged a shift
   towards longitudinal assessments from the pre-project stage through the
   implementation and operating phases. Experience and study show, however,
   that assessment of infrastructure-intensive projects rarely endures past
   the project's construction phase. Negative consequences for
   environmental, social and health outcomes have been documented. Such
   consequences clarify the pressing need for longitudinal assessment in
   each of these domains, with human rights impact assessment (HRIA) as an
   umbrella over, and critical augmentation of, environmental, social and
   health assessments. Project impacts on human rights are more closely
   linked to political, economic and other factors beyond immediate effects
   of a company's policy and action throughout the project lifecycle.
   Delineating these processes requires an adequate framework, with
   strategies for collecting longitudinal data, protocols that provide core
   information for impact assessment and guidance for adaptive mitigation
   strategies as project-related effects change overtime. This article
   presents general principles for the design and implementation of
   sustained, longitudinal HRIA, based on experience assessing and
   responding to human rights impact in a uranium mining project in Malawi.
   The case study demonstrates the value of longitudinal assessment both
   for limiting corporate risk and improving human welfare. (C) 2014

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Application of agricultural pesticides poses health concerns for
   farmworkers and for local communities due to pesticide drift from
   spraying or fumigation, pesticide volatilization into the air,
   contamination of household dust, as well as di-rect exposure for people
   who work in agriculture and their families. In this analysis of
   pesticide use records for Ventura County, California (USA) from 2016 to
   2018, we identified the most prevalent toxicological effects of the
   pesticides applied. We also developed a cumulative toxicity index that
   incorporates specific toxicity endpoints for individual pes-ticides, the
   severity and strength of association for each endpoint, and the
   reliability of the data sources. Combining the toxicity index for each
   pesticide with the pounds applied within each square mile section in
   Ventura County, we cal-culated the total toxicity-weighted pesticide use
   and identified pesticides associated with higher potential risk to
   health. Analysis of U.S. Census data for Ventura County found a greater
   percentage of Hispanic/Latino, African American and Asian community
   members in township sections with a greater volume of pesticides applied
   and higher toxicity-weighted pesticide use. Similarly, areas with
   limited economic and social resources had elevated pesticide
   ap-plication overall and elevated toxicity-weighted pesticide use. The
   combination of toxicological and demographic analyses presented in this
   study provides information that can support the development of policies
   to protect public health from excessive exposure to pesticides and
   better environmental health protection for socially vulnerable

Abstract = {Predicting cumulative effects is an important challenge of theoretical
   and management ecology. If a population will be exposed to multiple
   stressors (e.g., toxins, introduced competitors, climate change), will
   their cumulative effects be independent and hence multiplicative (the
   population survival rates due to each stressor can be multiplied
   together to determine the total reduction in abundance), synergistic
   (cumulative effects are greater than multiplicative), or antagonistic
   (stressors offset each other so cumulative effects are less than
   multiplicative)? Further, the effects of each stressor can vary with
   such factors as habitat quality, population density, and weather. It is
   difficult to predict cumulative effects with traditional
   population-level models because such models must assume the type and
   strength of stressor interactions a priori, and measuring stressor
   effects and interactions empirically is rarely practical. Instead, we
   used an individual-based model in which cumulative effects emerge from
   how each stressor affects the growth and survival of individuals, and
   how individuals interact. Our model is in fact based on theoretical
   concepts explored in the landmark 1980 paper of DeAngelis et al.
   (Cannibalism and size dispersal in young-of-the-year largemouth bass:
   experiment and model, Ecol. Model. 8, 133-148): in a community of fish
   that eat each other, initial differences in size among individuals have
   strong effects on subsequent abundance and size distributions. We model
   survival and growth of juvenile Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus
   lucius) during their first year, and two stressors they are subject to.
   The first stressor is a daily cycle of flow fluctuations imposed by an
   upstream hydroelectric dam; these fluctuations affect habitat area, food
   supply, and temperature, which then affect juvenile fish growth. Second
   is an introduced fish species that competes with pikeminnow for food,
   while both species can prey on each other via the size-based mechanism
   described by DeAngelis et al. We simulated the effects of the 36
   combinations of six levels of these two stressors in each of 28 sites
   and weather year to produce 840 scenarios, using 7 weather year datasets
   as replicates. Emergent cumulative effects were multiplicative in 69\%
   of these scenarios, synergistic in 22\%, and antagonistic in 9\%.
   Therefore, any a priori assumption about stressor interactions would be
   wrong in many situations. Synergistic effects were most common in deeper
   and larger habitats favorable to the introduced species; antagonistic
   effects were most common in smaller habitats where the introduced
   species had low growth, because flow fluctuations further reduced the
   small food supply. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecotoxicological effect studies often expose test organisms under
   optimal environmental conditions. However, organisms in their natural
   settings rarely experience optimal conditions. On the contrary, during
   most of their lifetime they are forced to cope with sub-optimal
   conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress.
   Interactions between the effects of a natural stressor and a toxicant
   can sometimes result in greater effects than expected from either of the
   stress types alone. The aim of the present review is to provide a
   synthesis of existing knowledge on the interactions between effects of
   ``natural{''} and chemical (anthropogenic) stressors. More than 150
   studies were evaluated covering stressors including heat, cold,
   desiccation, oxygen depletion, pathogens and immunomodulatory factors
   combined with a variety of environmental pollutants. This evaluation
   revealed that synergistic interactions between the effects of various
   natural stressors and toxicants are not uncommon phenomena. Thus,
   synergistic interactions were reported in more than 50\% of the
   available studies on these interactions. Antagonistic interactions were
   also detected, but in fewer cases. Interestingly, about 70\% of the
   tested chemicals were found to compromise the immune system of humans as
   judged from studies on human cell lines. The challenge for future
   studies will therefore be to include aspects of combined stressors in
   effect and risk assessment of chemicals in the environment. (C) 2009

Title = {From environmental impact assessment to strategic environmental
   assessment in Bangladesh: Evolution, perspective, governance and
   challenges},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {How do Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental
   Assessment (SEA) evolve in Bangladesh regarding legislation? Who should
   be in the governance of SEA in Bangladesh? What future challenges lie
   ahead of this transition to the SEA system in Bangladesh, and how to
   address them? The application context of SEA is in its early stage of
   development in Bangladesh as an environmental assessment tool for
   policy, plans, and programs (PPPs). Nevertheless, SEA has meaningfully
   started to roll in many PPPs by the political will of some key
   government institutions in Bangladesh. In such a scenario, we aimed to
   review the progression of EIA to SEA evolution in line with the current
   legislative practice and environmental governance by archival research
   strategy. We have further addressed several significant issues: the
   future of SEA application in Bangladesh, SEA governance within the
   authorities and the future obstacles of the SEA system and how to
   overcome them in Bangladesh. This study shows a potential for applying
   the SEA for developing PPPs to ensure sustainable development in
   Bangladesh. However, there are still challenges ahead to make the SEA
   fully functional. The challenges include the environmental governance
   concerning SEA, encoding SEA guidelines, and legislations associated
   with SEA implementation. Moreover, capacity building, technical review
   of SEA quality, and approval process of SEA reporting and coordination
   among the government institutions are required. To address the
   challenges, governance for the institutional authority for SEA and
   ownership development is necessary. Furhtermore, amendment of existing
   environmental acts and guidelines to incorporate SEA, institutional
   capacity building by professional training and awareness development,
   mainstreaming SEA education and practices are required to overcome the
   challenges.},

Abstract = {The multiple anthropogenic threats to marine ecosystems and the
   increasing spatial conflicts in the Adriatic -Ionian Region (AIR)
   require transnational, integrated and efficient planning of coastal and

   information, data and decision support tools for ocean planning in the
   Adriatic-Ionian sea space. The GAIR is an open source platform; it
   supports co-production of MSP-relevant knowledge based on 12 databases,
   portals and tools developed within a set of European projects supporting
   the implementation of the European Strategy for the AIR (EUSAIR). The
   study presents the GAIR's software architecture, its technological stack
   and the seven integrated geospatial tools. A case study of the tool
   presents its user workflow and main outputs. The paper concludes with an
   evaluation of the GAIR with respect to MSP, Sustainable Blue Economy and
   the implementation of the EUSAIR Action Plan.},

Volume = {102},
Number = {A},
Pages = {248-257},

Abstract = {As recently reinforced in the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive
   (MSFD), knowledge on the location and intensity of human impacts on
   marine ecosystems is critical for effective marine management and
   conservation. Human interaction with ecosystems has to be accounted for
   in order to efficiently implement marine management strategies. In the
   present study, the main human activities occurring along the mainland
   Portuguese coast were identified and mapped. The cumulative impact of
   these activities was calculated in order to assess impacts in different
   zones, namely in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and their boundaries.
   Higher impact values were obtained near the coast, where all the
   analysed MPAs are located. Furthermore, most MPAs are sorrounded by
   areas with very high impacts, near the largest urban settlements and the
   most industrialized coastal sections. These results are the first
   assessment of cumulative human pressures in this study area as a whole
   (and with this level of resolution) and might be of great usefulness to
   overcome the current challenges of sustainable management in marine
   ecosystems. Knowledge provided by this study strengthens the need for a
   more integrative approach to design and manage MPAs and can be useful to
   support the requirements of the MSFD. The approach here developed is
   also a powerful tool to apply in several contexts of sustainable marine
   management and can be developed in any geographic area. (c) 2014

Abstract = {Environmental impact assessment (EIA) developed in the latter half of
   the 20th century as a response to growing concern about the impacts of
   human development on the environment and a recognition of the inadequacy
   of existing approaches to environmental management. Once an uncertain
   and new area, it is now ubiquitous in the approval process for projects
   across the world. It is trite law to say that the impacts of proposed
   activities should be considered in the process to determine whether the
   proposed activities should be permitted. However, EIA is often
   understood broadly and leaves many issues unresolved. What is an impact
   of development? How far removed (how indirect) can the impacts be that
   an EIA can consider? What about the cumulative impacts of similar
   projects? When can these be taken into account? This article identifies
   three contemporary issues in EIA, assessed in the context of climate
   change: the scope of EIA, cumulative impacts and temporal problems.},

   elements of existing international law as it relates to EA as context.
   Twelve elements of `Next Generation EA' are introduced as a standard
   against which to evaluate the results of the negotiations and as
   inspiration for the EA elements of a new legally binding instrument.
   While the negotiations have established a reasonably solid basis for
   effective project level assessments, further improvements are needed.
   Much more work remains on regional and strategic assessments and the
   proper integration of the EA regime into effective governance of the

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the benefits and costs of hydropower
   development in the Mekong River Basin. We compare four major reports-the
   Mekong River Commission's (MRC's) Basin Development Plan Programme,
   Phase 2 (BDP2), the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Hydropower on
   the Mekong Mainstream (SEA), the Study on the Impacts of Mainstream
   Hydropower on the Mekong River (MDS), and the MRC's recent council study
   (CS)-in order to provide the basis for a comparative analysis of the
   major impact evaluation literature on mainstream dam construction in the
   Mekong River Basin for the period of 2010-2018. The primary objective of
   the review is to identify points of agreement, disagreement,
   inconsistency, and knowledge gaps. Both Mekong River Commission reports
   (BDP2 and CS) suggest extensive economic benefits for proposed
   hydropower development, whereas the SEA and MDS indicate that the net
   impact would be negative. The projected impacts of hydropower
   development on fisheries, sediment flows, and ecosystems vary widely
   both in economic and biophysical terms. However, all four reports point
   to decreased food security and loss of local livelihoods for millions of
   people as major concerns related to dam development. While considerable
   resources have been devoted to producing these important studies, the
   lack of standardization across reports, especially assumptions and
   methodologies for economic impacts, frustrates efforts at meaningful
   comparison of their findings and precludes the prospect of clear
   analytical outcomes or policy impacts. This article is categorized

Title = {A paradigm for understanding whole ecosystem effects of offshore wind
   farms in shelf seas},
Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 12},
Abstract = {With the rapid expansion of offshore windfarms (OWFs) globally, there is
   an urgent need to assess and predict effects on marine species,
   habitats, and ecosystem functioning. Doing so at shelf-wide scale while
   simultaneously accounting for the concurrent influence of climate change
   will require dynamic, multitrophic, multiscalar, ecosystem-centric
   approaches. However, as such studies and the study system itself (shelf
   seas) are complex, we propose to structure future environmental research
   according to the investigative cycle framework. This will allow the
   formulation and testing of specific hypotheses built on ecological
   theory, thereby streamlining the process, and allowing adaptability in
   the face of technological advancements (e.g. floating offshore wind) and
   shifting socio-economic and political climates. We outline a strategy by
   which to accelerate our understanding of environmental effects of OWF
   development on shelf seas, which is illustrated throughout by a North
   Sea case study. Priorities for future studies include ascertaining the
   extent to which OWFs may change levels of primary production; whether
   wind energy extraction will have knock-on effects on biophysical
   ecosystem drivers; whether pelagic fishes mediate changes in top
   predator distributions over space and time; and how any effects observed
   at localized levels will scale and interact with climate change and
   fisheries displacement effects.},

Abstract = {The nation's estuaries are at risk of further deterioration from land
   use change and intensification.  These risks include direct impacts on
   wetland habitats and stream environments and indirect impacts from
   nonpoint source pollutant loading. This article reports on the methods,
   findings, and policy implications of a major study, ``The Effects of
   Land Use Change and Intensification on the San Francisco Estuary.{''} By
   using a geographic information system (GIS), future growth scenarios
   were played out and the impacts on wetlands, streams, and water quality
   were estimated on a regionwide basis.
   The land use scenario developed from the General Plans of the Bay-Delta
   Region's 12 counties shows that the total area planned as urban use
   outside existing incorporated cities is 331,530 acres, an increase of 3
   7\%. This land use change and intensification associated with increased
   growth will continue to stress an overtaxed estuarine system. Results
   are expressed according to 14 receiving water segments and the
   associated 34 watersheds.
   Direct impacts on wetlands and strewn environment zones occur in every
   watershed containing these resources. We estimate that over 39,500 acres
   of wetlands may be.potentially impacted. Of 377,000 acres of stream
   environment in the 12-county study area, 28,000 acres are also subject
   to impacts of urbanization. Our analysis suggests that protection of
   farmed wetlands in the Delta and North Bay and the enhancement of
   biodiversity in the South Bay deserve special attention. The
   construction of land use scenarios for the estuary region has presented,
   for the first time, an opportunity to examine the cumulative
   contribution of nonpoint source urban runoff to the levels of pollutants
   in the bay and delta. To date, more modest studies in smaller urban
   watersheds have provided only a glimpse of the overall effect that
   urbanization has in a region the size of the estuary. We found that
   these impacts can be expected to decrease the overall water quality of
   the estuary.
   The existing system of land use planning delegates responsibility to
   local governments. However, of 111 jurisdictions within the estuary
   study region, only 18 have specific ordinances to protect streams and
   wetlands. We recommend that the existing system regulation and
   management be strengthened to protect, enhance, and restore the
   environmental well-being of the estuary. The results of our study
   suggest that improvements are needed in the goals, management
   strategies, and institutional arrangements now in place for the San
   Francisco estuary. We advance several specific management options to
   help frame the debate over strengthening estuarine management. In
   particular, we urge that a specific focus on estuarine resource
   protection be incorporated in any new growth management legislation
   enacted in California.
   We identify several important national policy implications arising from
   our study. First, we believe the potential transferability of our
   methodology to other estuaries should be investigated. Second, we
   recommend that technical workshops be convened for estuarine managers
   who are addressing similar management issues. Third, we recommend that
   policy guidance to encourage the use of watersheds and receiving waters
   as the unit for analysis. We also recommend that GIS-based analysis
   should be used to test the implications of alternative wetland
   definitions to inform the national policy debate.},

Abstract = {Since being elected in 2015, Canada's federal Liberal government has
   taken steps to overhaul major environment-related laws and policies,
   including federal environmental assessment (EA) and regulatory
   processes. During 2016-2017, a government-appointed panel toured Canada
   and received > 1000 suggestions from diverse sectors of society
   regarding EA reform. Yet, different sectors of society may have
   different views concerning scientific components of EA. We analyzed
   written submissions during public consultation (categorized into five
   sectors) regarding five key scientific components of EA: (1) openly
   sharing information, (2) evaluating cumulative effects, (3) scientific
   rigour, (4) transparency in decision-making, and (5) independence
   between regulators and proponents. On the whole, submissions from
   Indigenous groups, non-governmental organizations, and
   individuals/academics supported strengthening all five components. In
   contrast, most contributions from industry/industry associations, and,
   to a lesser extent, government bodies or agencies, suggested that there
   was no need for increased scientific rigour or increased independence.
   These findings indicate that there is cross-sectoral support for
   strengthening some scientific aspects of EA. However, the degree to
   which the Government of Canada strengthens the scientific rigour and
   independence of EA will indicate whether environmental decision-making
   in Canada is aligned with preferences from industry or the rest of
   Canada.},

Title = {An empirical model using dissolved oxygen as an indicator for
   eutrophication at a regional scale},
Journal = {MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN},

Volume = {133},
Pages = {261-270},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple empirical models can sometimes capture salient patterns without
   sacrificing predictive capacity when compared to more complex models.
   Herein we examine dissolved oxygen as an indicator of eutrophication
   status for shallow estuaries. Dissolved oxygen was measured hourly in
   the upper estuary of 15 watersheds along a nutrient-loading and
   geographic gradient. Metrics describing hypoxia and supersaturation were
   devised and then analyzed using multivariate statistics, Results
   revealed independent responses for hypoxia and super saturation with
   hypoxia-related metrics correlating strongly with water residence. A
   metric integrating hypoxia and supersaturation effectively discriminated
   between seagrass and algae-dominated habitats and was significantly
   correlated with both water residence and nitrate-N loading. Chlorophyll,
   measured bi-weekly, was not correlated with our predictor variables
   likely because it does not account for benthic production. Over 70\% of
   the variability in hypoxia was explained by water residence and
   nitrate-N loading indicating that this model can be of use for managers.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to understand the extent to which ecological
   connectivity has been considered in EIA in Canada. Several factors that
   may influence the consideration of connectivity were analyzed in an
   evaluation of 14 environmental impact statements (EIS) obtained from the
   Canadian Impact Assessment Registry. Connectivity is largely absent from
   the EIA process, and even projects that attempted to consider
   connectivity lacked the rigor required to effectively assess impacts on
   connectivity. Projects that included connectivity as a valued component
   performed somewhat better, whereas the assessment of connectivity was
   not affected by different federal environmental acts (CEAA 1992 vs. CEAA
   2012), development sectors, or proponent types. Between sections of the
   EIS, a significantly greater number of evaluation criteria were met in
   the scoping section compared to all other sections. Without adequate
   guidance, connectivity analysis in EIA has been conducted ad hoc, with
   considerable variation in quality. Including connectivity consideration
   in EIA legislation would provide a legal framework to address the lack
   of policies, standards, and assessment guidelines. We provide
   recommendations for integrating connectivity in EIA in Canada and
   elsewhere.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of international initiatives aim to reconcile
   development with conservation. Crucial to successful implementation of
   these initiatives is a comprehensive understanding of the current
   ecological condition of landscapes and their spatial distributions.
   Here, we provide a cumulative measure of human modification of
   terrestrial lands based on modeling the physical extents of 13
   anthropogenic stressors and their estimated impacts using spatially
   explicit global datasets with a median year of 2016. We quantified the
   degree of land modification and the amount and spatial configuration of
   low modified lands (i.e., natural areas relatively free from human
   alteration) across all ecoregions and biomes. We identified that fewer
   unmodified lands remain than previously reported and that most of the
   world is in a state of intermediate modification, with 52\% of
   ecoregions classified as moderately modified. Given that these
   moderately modified ecoregions fall within critical land use thresholds,
   we propose that they warrant elevated attention and require proactive
   spatial planning to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function before
   important environmental values are lost.},

Abstract = {A hydrological analysis of historic stream data collected with the gauge
   on the Cache River at Patterson, Arkansas, USA, is presented as the
   basis for cumulative impact analysis of riverine wetlands. Subtle,
   long-term changes in hydroperiod, which could collectively have major
   effects on wetland function, are quantified. Harmonic analysis,
   time-scale analysis, and conventional methods of hydrological analysis
   of gauge data, at decade intervals, are employed, showing a steady
   decline in the magnitude and predictability of the baseflow during low
   flow periods, beginning with the 1920s and becoming increasingly more
   pronounced into the 1980s. Complementary information suggests that
   hydroperiod alterations are associated with increased groundwater
   pumping to support rice agriculture in the basin. These hydrological
   methods are simple enough for routine application (when adequate data
   are available) but sufficiently sophisticated to identify subtle changes
   in hydroperiod associated with cumulative effects. The changes in
   hydroperiod identified using these methods may have potential to explain
   changes in biotic communities or wetlands structure as part of
   comprehensive wetlands studies. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The U.S. is adopting a Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) approach to address
   conflicting objectives of conservation and resource development and
   usage in marine spaces. At this time MSP remains primarily as a concept
   rather than a well-defined framework, however expanding anthropogenic
   impacts on coastal and marine areas reinforce the need to adopt an MSP
   approach to manage societal demands while preserving the marine
   environment. The development of theory and methods to implement MSP are
   on the rise across the nation to address coastal and marine
   environmental challenges. Critical components of marine spatial planning
   are (1) spatial data collection, (2) data management, (3) data analysis,
   and (4) decision support systems. Advances in geotechnology have
   increased access to spatial data enabling the development of decision
   support tools to organize, analyze, and inform the MSP process by
   projecting future scenarios. A review of the current literature reveals
   the available technological and methodological tools that are best
   suited for marine spatial planning, as well as suggests areas for
   further research in order to better inform this process in the U.S. (C)

Abstract = {Regional environmental assessment (EA) requires the participation of
   policy- and plan-making institutions to formulate, implement and monitor
   regional environmental management strategies. However, there is little
   understanding of what effective integration is in the context of
   regional EA and from the perspectives of planners and policy-makers
   involved. This paper seeks to explore how institutional actors perceive
   cross-domain integration vis-a-vis their own involvement in regional
   EAs. Thirty-eight participants from four regional EA initiatives in
   Canada shared their perspectives in an online survey. Three types of
   silo effects are identified: (1) institutional - intricately linked to
   factors such as coordination, goals and expectations, leadership and
   capacity; (2) disciplinary - characterized by limited communication and
   scepticism around data sharing; and (3) transactional - tendency of
   actors to emphasize individual narrow perspective rather than collective
   social and environmental outcomes. Additional findings reveal the
   importance of learning and multiple domain expertise as opportunities

Title = {Characterizing Exposure to and Sharing Knowledge of Drivers of
   Environmental Change in the St. Lawrence System in Canada},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {The St. Lawrence is a vast and complex socio-ecological system providing
   a wealth of services that sustain numerous economic sectors. This
   ecosystem is subject to significant human pressures that overlap and
   potentially interact with climate-driven environmental changes. Our
   objective in this paper was to systematically characterize the
   distribution and intensity of drivers of environmental change
   (hereafter, drivers) in the St. Lawrence System. We gathered data-based
   indicators for 22 coastal, climate, fisheries, and marine traffic
   drivers through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and
   open data portals. We show that few areas of the St. Lawrence are free
   of cumulative exposure. The Estuary, Anticosti Gyre, and coastal areas
   are particularly exposed, especially in the vicinity of urban centers.
   We identified six distinct clusters with similar suites of co-occurring
   drivers and show that certain driver combinations are inherent to
   different regions of the St. Lawrence and that coastal areas are exposed
   to all driver types. Of particular concern are two clusters capturing
   most exposure hotspots and that show the convergence of contrasting
   cumulative exposure profiles at the head of the Laurentian Channel.
   Sharing knowledge of drivers emerged as a priority to facilitate future
   environmental assessment efforts. We thus launch eDrivers, an open
   knowledge platform gathering experts committed to structuring,
   standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers of environmental change
   in support of holistic science and management. eDrivers was built on a
   series of guiding principles upholding existing data management and open
   science standards. We therefore expect it to evolve through time to
   address knowledge gaps and refine current driver layers. Ultimately, we
   believe that eDrivers represents a much needed solution that could
   radically influence broad scale research and management practices by
   increasing knowledge accessibility and interoperability.},

Title = {Latent class analysis of the association between polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon exposures and body mass index},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {121},
Number = {1},
Pages = {227-231},

Abstract = {Background: People experience multiple co-occurring exposures to
   environmental pollutants, but analyses of multiple exposures have rarely
   been reported.
   Objectives: We used latent class analysis to estimate co-exposures to
   multiple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and tested the
   associations of latent classes to body mass index.
   Methods: We analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   (NHANES) 2013-2014 data. The sample included 2354 people aged 6-80
   years. Measures included seven urinary PAH metabolites, BMI, and
   demographic and behavioral covariates. People were classified into
   mutually exclusive latent classes characterized by unique profiles of
   multiple PAH exposures. These classes were used as categorical
   independent variables in weighted multiple regression models with BMI as
   the dependent measure. Models were analyzed overall and by age groups
   (6-19, 20-59, and 60 and over.) We compared results using latent classes
   to results using a summed PAH exposure measure.
   Results: Five latent classes were identified. Two of these classes were
   significantly associated with higher BMI overall (p < .0001) and for the
   two youngest age groups. One of these classes was characterized by high
   multiple exposures across all PAHs, and one by moderate exposures but
   relatively high naphthalene and phenanthrene. The summed PAH score was
   associated with higher BMI only for the youngest age group.
   Conclusions: Persons experience multiple co-exposures to PAHs that are
   related to BMI and obesity across age groups. Latent class analysis
   provides information on higher order interactions among multiple
   chemicals that a summed score does not. Future work may apply this
   approach to other outcomes or types of co-exposures.},

Journal = {EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {When Indigenous rights and demands for mineral wealth collide, knowledge
   of mining impacts is a highly contested area. Yet the scholarly
   literature contains few studies of the impacts borne by Indigenous
   groups. In this paper, we offer an empirical analysis of mining impacts
   on Sami reindeer herding in two cases from Sweden. The mine in
   Kaunisvaara is an active, open-pit iron mine operated by Kaunis Iron.
   The mine in Stihke was an underground copper/zinc mine operated from
   1976 to 1988 by Boliden. Data generation comprised of interviews,
   workshops, field visits, participatory GIS, and literature review. The
   findings show how the two mines have caused similar impacts, including
   on the land and the reindeer, the economy, and Sami culture, health, and
   well-being. In a comparative analysis we discuss five themes: i)
   discrepancies between anticipated and actual impacts, ii) mismatches
   between impacts and compensation, iii) flaws in Swedish mining
   regulations - specifically for impact assessment, iv) who holds relevant
   knowledge to predict impacts, and v) patterns of dispossession rather
   than co-existence. We argue that if governments and mining companies
   were to genuinely consider the full scale of impacts, then it would
   entail a fundamental paradigm shift in mining governance in Sweden.},

   Impact Assessment: Findings from an empirical study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {117-123},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Land take is emerging as a global environmental concern, and is
   particularly critical in intensively developed and land-scarce regions.
   This paper seeks to understand the effectiveness of the screening stage
   of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in addressing land take.
   Screening is the stage where a decision is made as to whether an EIA is
   required for a project. In many jurisdictions, screening results in
   three pathways: full EIA directly, preliminary EIA only, or preliminary
   EIA followed by full EIA. We compared the land take of 217 projects
   triggering the different pathways in a study region in Italy over a
   15-year time interval. Land take was quantified by overlaying the
   footprint of the projects with a land cover map.
   The results show that while more attention was given to projects with
   larger land take impacts overall, the cumulative land take from smaller
   projects not triggering full EIA was considerable (40\% of overall land
   take). The case-by-case examination conducted through the preliminary
   EIA was found to work better for some project types (ski areas and small
   urban development), than for others (quarries). Our findings lead us to
   advocate improvements in current screening procedures to ensure that the
   land take impacts are quantified and made explicit in preliminary EIA
   reports. Our evidence-based approach to determining land take in EIA
   provides a compelling basis for understanding ways to improve EIA
   policies, guidance and practice.},

Title = {Disappearing rivers - The limits of environmental assessment for
   hydropower in India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {135-143},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The mountain rivers of the Indian Himalaya possess a vast potential for
   hydropower generation. After decades of comparatively modest development
   recent years have seen a major intensification in the construction of
   new hydropower dams. Although increasingly portrayed as a form of
   renewable energy generation, hydropower development may lead to
   extensive alterations of fluvial systems and conflicts with resource use
   patterns of local communities. To appraise and reduce adverse effects is
   the purpose of statutory Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and
   corresponding mitigation plans. However, in the light of ambitious
   policies for hydropower expansion conventional approaches of
   environmental assessment are increasingly challenged to keep up with the
   intensity and pace of development. This paper aims to explore the
   systemic limitations of environmental assessment for hydropower
   development in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Based on a
   qualitative methodology involving interviews with environmental experts,
   document reviews and field observations the study suggests that the
   current practice of constraining ElAs to the project level fails to
   address the larger effects of extensive hydropower development.
   Furthermore, it is critically discussed as to what extent the concept of
   Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) might have the potential to
   overcome existing shortcomings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The ecological condition of many urban waterways in Australia is poor

Abstract = {A convincing case has been made that the scale of human activity has
   reached such pervasiveness that humans are akin to a force of nature.
   How environmental science responds to the many new challenges of the
   Anthropocene is at the forefront of the field. The aim of this
   perspective is to describe Anthropocene as a concept and a time period
   and discuss its relevance to the contemporary study of environmental
   science. Specifically, we consider areas in environmental science which
   may need to be revisited to adjust to complexity of the new era: (a)
   recalibrate the idea of environmental baselines as Anthropogenic
   baselines; (b) rethink multiple stressor approaches to recognize a
   system under flux; (c) re-evaluate the relationship of environmental
   science with other disciplines, particularly Earth Systems Science, but
   also social sciences and humanities. The all-encompassing nature of the
   Anthropocene necessitates the need to revise and reorganize to meet the
   challenge of complexity.},

Abstract = {Kenya is among the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to formally
   require the assessment of public policies, plans and programs. National
   strategic environmental assessment (SEA) guidelines were finalized in
   2012 to adapt and enhance SEA practice in the Kenyan context. The
   purpose of this research was to examine recent Kenyan SEA, with a
   particular emphasis on public participation, by developing and applying
   an analysis framework that both incorporates commonly accepted SEA
   principles and approaches and is cognizant of the national context in
   shaping SEA practice. Results reveal that a number of SEA practices are
   consistent with the framework in the nine cases considered, such as
   containing standard SEA components and developing monitoring plans. A
   requirement that each SEA must include educating the public about SEA is
   an innovative local adaptation. Results also show a number of practices
   that are still emerging, such as initiating SEA early and disseminating
   results to the participants. We conclude that SEA is still developing in
   Kenya, but processes for conducting it are slowly adapting to the Kenyan
   context.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity impact assessments under threatened species legislation
   often focus on individual development proposals at a single location,
   usually for a single species, leading to inadequate assessments of
   multiple impacts that accumulate over large spatial scales for multiple
   species. Regulations requiring ad-hoc assessments can lead to death by a
   thousand cuts, where biodiversity is degraded by many small impacts that
   individually do not appear to threaten species' persistence. Spatial
   prioritization methods can improve the efficiency of decision-making by
   explicitly considering cumulative impacts of multiple proposed
   developments on multiple species over large spatial scales. We present
   an assessment approach and a unique case study in which spatial
   prioritization tools were used to support strategic assessment of a
   large development plan in Western Australia. The application of the
   approach helped identify relatively minor alterations to development
   plans that resulted in reductions in biodiversity impacts and informed
   expansion of the protected area network. Using these tools to assess
   trade-offs between conservation and development will help identify
   planning footprints that minimize biodiversity losses.},

Title = {Coupling Satellite Data with Species Distribution and Connectivity
   Models as a Tool for Environmental Management and Planning in
   Matrix-Sensitive Species},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-143},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered
   major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence,
   connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have
   serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of
   populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites
   are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as
   inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in
   the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is
   mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional
   connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we
   highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs)
   derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of
   spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of
   conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution
   model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where
   suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape
   resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate
   the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the
   metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved
   to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated
   populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine
   resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures
   known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity
   such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible
   implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice
   of environmental impact assessments.},

Title = {A roadmap for multiple stressors assessment and management in freshwater
   ecosystems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Multiple stressors resulting from anthropogenic actions are increasingly
   recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. In general,
   ecosystems change as they respond to multiple threats that interact in
   complex ways, depending on the natural environment. This scenario poses
   complex tasks for researchers, managers, and policymakers, which require
   a well-defined framework to provide a clear roadmap that identify steps
   to apply in adaptive management decisions, monitoring designs and policy
   implementation. Building upon core elements of previous work, we present
   a Multiple Stressors Assessment Framework (MSAF) for aquatic ecosystems
   that provides a roadmap on the achievement of an improved integration
   between monitoring designs, data acquisition, evaluation processes, and
   management actions. The MSAF involves seven steps: 1) problem
   formulation and the definition of the ecosystem type and the
   spatial-temporal scale, 2) data compilation on the ecosystems'
   environmental characteristics and the definition of the type, identity
   and intensity of environmental stressors, 3) data compilation/collection
   on the biological/ecological receptors (endpoints) to stressors and
   selection of response variable to monitor (based on structure-based
   indicators and functional metrics), 4) characterization of the
   stressor-response relationships and their interactions, 5) construction
   of specific ecological conceptual models and choice of adequate
   statistical approaches to test the conceptual models' viability, 6)
   generation of hypotheses on interactive effects on biological/ecological
   endpoints, validation of models, hypotheses testing and, if possible,
   comparison of results with controlled experiments in realistic settings,
   and 7) recommendations to adaptive monitoring and if necessary,
   improvement of the study design, and eventual inclusion of other
   hypotheses and statistical approaches in the context of adaptive
   management actions. We review progress made in Europe, the USA and
   Canada in this field using case examples, highlight the approaches taken
   by the different jurisdictions that align with our framework and
   identify the linkages between multiple stressors assessments and
   decision-making for each region. We conclude that a disconnection
   remains between the investigation of the combined effects of multiple
   stressors and the implementation of management practices and policy
   translation. The way forward is through a collaborative effort to create
   standardized methodologies and appropriate programmes in this field. We
   hope the proposed framework can be used as a foundation to diagnose
   multiple stressor interactions and identify responses of ecological
   indicators to inform effective adaptive management of freshwater
   ecosystems globally.},

Title = {A comparative framework to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries in
   a global context},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although an ecosystem approach to fisheries has been recognized as a
   means of progressing toward sustainable fishing, successful
   implementation of this approach has been limited. However, one way in
   which progress has been made is through the use of suites of indicators.
   Decision tree frameworks can be used to incorporate trends in
   ecological, fishing, and environmental indicators into ecosystem
   assessments. A relatively generic decision tree framework has been
   developed and successfully applied to multiple ecosystems. This
   framework incorporates trends in indicators, as well as the impacts of
   fishing pressure and environmental variability on ecological indicators
   in order to assess the state of each ecosystem. The inclusion of
   ecosystem expert knowledge from the outset ensures trends are correctly
   interpreted and allows analyses to contribute to global comparisons in a
   robust and meaningful manner. Although ecological and environmental
   indicators are well developed, those addressing the human dimensions of
   marine ecosystems are less so. This framework holds the potential to
   incorporate such indicators in order to fully assess marine ecosystems
   in a comparative context. Such assessments could help ensure food
   security from marine resources into the future as well as ensuring the
   well-being of coastal communities. Here critical review of the potential
   value of this framework has been conducted, with its usefulness
   emphasized in the similarities it holds, and in the contribution it
   could make, to current global methods of ecosystem assessments.},

Abstract = {This paper presents and demonstrates a spatial framework for the
   application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in the context
   of change analysis for urban wetland environments. The proposed
   framework is focused on two key stages of the SEA process: scoping and
   environmental baseline assessment. These stages are arguably the most
   information-intense phases of SEA and have a significant effect on the
   quality of the SEA results. The study aims to meet the needs for
   proactive frameworks to assess and protect wetland habitat and services
   more efficiently, toward the goal of advancing more intelligent urban
   planning and development design. The proposed framework, adopting
   geographic information system and remote sensing tools and applications,
   supports the temporal evaluation of wetland change and sustainability
   assessment based on landscape indicator analysis. The framework was
   applied to a rapidly developing urban environment in the City of
   Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, analyzing wetland change and land-use
   pressures from 1985 to 2011. The SEA spatial scale was rescaled from
   administrative urban planning units to an ecologically meaningful area.
   Landscape change assessed was based on a suite of indicators that were
   subsequently rolled up into a single, multi-dimensional, and easy to
   understand and communicate index to examine the implications of land-use
   change for wetland sustainability. The results show that despite the
   recent extremely wet period in the Canadian prairie region, land-use
   change contributed to increasing threats to wetland sustainability.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {110-134},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems and the fisheries they support are increasingly
   threatened by human activities. To aid in their management and
   protection, we outline nine key principles for supporting healthy and
   productive ecosystems based on the best available science, including
   laws of physics and chemistry apply to ecology; population dynamics are
   regulated by reproduction, mortality, and growth; habitat quantity and
   quality are prerequisites of fish productivity; connectivity among
   habitats is essential for movements of fishes and their resources;
   freshwater species and their habitats are tightly linked to surrounding
   watersheds; biodiversity can enhance ecosystem resiliency and
   productivity; global processes affect local populations; anthropogenic
   stressors have cumulative effects; and evolutionary processes can be
   important. Based on these principles, we provide general recommendations
   for managing and protecting freshwater ecosystems and the fisheries they
   support, with examples of successful implementation for each strategy.
   Key management strategies include engage and consult with stakeholders;
   ensure that agencies have sufficient capacity, legislation, and
   authority to implement policies and management plans; define metrics by
   which fisheries resources and management success or failure will be
   measured; identify and account for threats to ecosystem productivity;
   adopt the precautionary approach to management; embrace adaptive
   management; implement ecosystem-based management; account for all
   ecosystem services provided by aquatic ecosystems; protect and restore
   habitat as the foundation for fisheries; and protect biodiversity.
   Ecosystems are complex with many intertwined components and ignoring
   linkages and processes significantly reduces the probability of
   management success. These principles must be considered when identifying
   management options and developing policies aiming to protect productive
   freshwater ecosystems and sustainable fisheries.},

Abstract = {Governments around the world rely on environmental impact assessment
   (EIA) to understand the environmental risks of proposed developments. To
   examine the basis for these appraisals, we examine the output of EIA
   processes in jurisdictions within seven countries, focusing on scope
   (spatial and temporal), mitigation actions and whether impacts were
   identified as `significant'. We find that the number of impacts
   characterized as significant is generally low. While this finding may
   indicate that EIA is successful at promoting environmentally sustainable
   development, it may also indicate that the methods used to assess impact
   are biased against findings of significance. To explore the methods
   used, we investigate the EIA process leading to significance
   determination. We find that EIA reports could be more transparent with
   regard to the spatial scale they use to assess impacts to wildlife. We
   also find that few reports on mining projects consider temporal scales
   that are precautionary with regard to the effects of mines on water
   resources. Across our sample of reports, we find that few EIAs
   meaningfully consider the different ways that cumulative impacts can
   interact. Across countries, we find that proposed mitigation measures
   are often characterized as effective without transparent justification,
   and sometimes are described in ways that render the mitigation measure
   proposal ambiguous. Across the reports in our sample, professional
   judgement is overwhelmingly the determinant of impact significance, with
   little transparency around the reasoning process involved or input by
   stakeholders. We argue that the credibility and accuracy of the EIA
   process could be improved by adopting more rigorous assessment
   methodologies and empowering regulators to enforce their use.

   Resumen
   Los gobiernos a nivel mundial cuentan con los estudios de impacto
   ambiental para comprender los riesgos ambientales de las propuestas de
   desarrollo. Para juzgar la fiabilidad de estas evaluaciones, evaluamos
   los resultados de los estudios de impacto ambiental en las
   jurisdicciones de siete paises, enfocandonos en ambitos (espaciales y
   temporales), las acciones de mitigacion y si los impactos fueron
   identificados como ``significativos{''}. Descubrimos que el numero de
   impactos adversos caracterizados como significativos fue generalmente
   bajo. Si bien este resultado puede indicar que la evaluacion de impacto
   ambiental es exitosa en la promocion del desarrollo ambiental
   sostenible, tambien puede indicar que los metodos utilizados para
   evaluar el impacto estan sesgados en contra de hallazgos de importancia.
   Para explorar los metodos utilizados, investigamos el proceso del
   estudio de impacto ambiental que conduce a la determinacion de
   importancia del impacto. Descubrimos que los informes de evaluacion de
   impacto ambiental podrian ser mas transparentes con respecto a la escala
   espacial utilizada para evaluar los impactos en la vida silvestre.
   Tambien encontramos que pocos informes sobre proyectos mineros
   consideran escalas temporales que son precautorias con respecto a los
   efectos de las minas sobre los recursos hidricos. En nuestra muestra de
   informes, encontramos que pocos estudios de impacto ambiental consideran
   de manera significativa las diferentes formas en que los impactos
   acumulativos pueden interactuar. En general encontramos que muchas de
   las medidas de mitigacion propuestas se caracterizan como efectivas sin
   una justificacion transparente y a veces se describen de manera que
   hacen que la propuesta de medida de mitigacion sea ambigua. En los
   informes de nuestra muestra, el juicio profesional es abrumadoramente el
   determinante de la importancia del impacto, sin una explicacion
   transparente de los procesos de razonamiento involucrados o aportes de
   las partes interesadas. Argumentamos que la credibilidad y precision del
   proceso de evaluacion de impacto ambiental podria mejorarse mediante la
   adopcion de metodologias de evaluacion mas rigurosas y el empoderamiento
   de los reguladores para hacer cumplir su uso.

   evaluons les resultats des etudes d'impact environnemental des
   juridictions de sept pays en nous concentrant sur la portee (spatiale et

   identifies comme significatifs. Nous constatons que le nombre d'impacts
   consideres comme significatifs est generalement faible. Bien que ce
   resultat puisse indiquer que l'etude d'impact environnemental est
   efficace pour promouvoir un developpement durable sur le plan
   environnemental, elle peut egalement indiquer que les methodes utilisees
   pour evaluer les impacts sont biaisees par rapport a la determination de
   leurs ampleurs. Pour explorer les methodes utilisees, nous etudions le
   processus d'etudes d'impact environnemental menant a la determination de
   l'ampleur d'un impact. Nous constatons que les rapports des etudes
   d'impact environnemental pourraient etre plus transparents en ce qui
   concerne l'echelle spatiale utilisee pour evaluer les impacts sur la
   faune. Nous constatons egalement que peu de rapports sur les projets
   miniers considerent des echelles temporelles qui sont preventives en ce
   qui concerne les effets des mines sur les ressources hydriques. Dans
   notre echantillon de rapports, nous constatons que peu d'evaluations
   d'impact environnemental prennent en compte de facon significative les
   differentes manieres par lesquelles les impacts cumulatifs peuvent
   interagir. travers les pays, nous constatons que les mesures
   d'attenuation proposees sont souvent caracterisees comme efficaces sans
   justification transparente et sont parfois decrites de maniere a rendre

   Resumo
   Instituicoes governamentais ao redor do mundo se baseiam e confiam nas
   avaliacoes de impacto ambiental como forma de se entender os riscos
   ambientais dos projetos submetidos ao licenciamento. Para examinar os
   fundamentos dessas avaliacoes, investigamos os estudos de impacto
   ambiental em jurisdicoes em sete paises diferentes, com foco no escopo
   espaco-temporal, medidas de mitigacAo e a significancia dos impactos.
   Concluimos que o numero de impactos caracterizados como significativos e
   geralmente baixo. Embora essa descoberta possa indicar que a avaliacAo
   de impacto ambiental e bem sucedida na promocAo do ambiente sustentavel,
   ela tambem pode indicar que os metodos utilizados para avaliar impactos
   podem ser tendenciosos no que tange a determinacAo da significancia.
   Concluimos que a escala espacial utilizada para avaliar os impactos a
   vida silvestre em estudos de impacto ambiental devem ter criterios de
   delimitacAo mais transparentes. Tambem concluimos que poucos estudos de
   empreendimentos de mineracAo consideram escalas temporais conservadoras
   em relacAo aos seus impactos em recursos hidricos. Ainda, em nossa
   amostra, descobrimos que poucos estudos de impacto ambiental consideram
   as diferentes maneiras pelas quais os impactos cumulativos podem
   interagir entre si. Em todos os paises, descobrimos que as medidas de
   mitigacAo propostas sAo frequentemente caracterizadas como eficazes sem
   justificativa evidente e, que sAo descritas de forma ambigua. Em nossa
   amostra, a significancia de impactos foi predominantemente determinada
   por julgamento profissional, com pouca transparencia no processo do
   raciocinio envolvido nessa determinacAo ou na consideracAo das
   contribuicoes de stakeholders. Argumentamos que a credibilidade e o
   rigor do processo de avaliacAo de impacto ambiental podem ser melhorados
   atraves da adocAo de metodologias mais rigorosas e capacitacAo dos
   agentes do governo a exigir o cumprimento das mesmas.

Abstract = {Notwithstanding ambiguities, long-term economic resurgence in
   Afghanistan amidst water insecurity exacerbated by climate change
   decisively requires a water protection strategy that will complement a
   multitude of agroindustrial and socioeconomic activities in an
   environmentally sustainable and climate resilient manner. In this paper,
   we begin with a perspective on institutions, legislation, and key issues
   in the water sector of Afghanistan. We then embark on linking the
   integrated water resources management (IWRM) and strategic environmental
   assessment (SEA) approaches as a novel framework for strategic water
   management and subsequently propose a strategy for post-conflict water
   protection based on the coalesced IWRM and SEA. Context relevant good
   practices worldwide are presented to provide empirical evidence for this
   approach whereas perceived opportunities and vulnerabilities in the
   Afghan context are discussed. Examination of post-conflict water sector
   initiatives in Afghanistan reveals the critical role of foreign
   assistance in both water infrastructure rehabilitation and modernization
   of the institutional aspect of water management. The introduction of
   IWRM as the basis for a progressive water sector strategy has been seen
   as a major milestone which is detrimentally matched by substantial
   deficiency in national capacity for implementation. Concurrently, the
   role of extra-national actors in relevant policy interventions has been
   considered catalytic despite criticisms of proposed regulations as being
   anachronistic to field realities. Therefore the view is maintained to
   practicable policies by accelerating policy learning in the country's
   water and environment sectors to encourage homegrown water strategy
   innovations. Demonstratively, mainstreaming IWRM-SEA coalescence will
   bridge institutional gaps for better feedback between local and national
   water stakeholders, providing a venue for improved delivery of water
   services to sustain post-conflict socioeconomic recovery and promote
   environmental stewardship. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Identifying ecological thresholds for regulating human activity:
   Effective conservation or wishful thinking?},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {57-65},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increasingly, conservation professionals and regulatory agencies are
   attempting to identify ecological thresholds that define a point at
   which populations or communities demonstrate a marked response to human
   disturbance. Such thresholds may serve as the foundation for recognizing
   and then imposing limits on the levels of disturbance or types of land
   use. Although an intuitive concept, I argue that there are numerous
   scientific and practical limitations to applying ecological thresholds
   to conservation decision making. First, the concept is limited by the
   lack of a clear and universally accepted definition. Often, a threshold
   is defined as the point at which a population demonstrates a nonlinear
   ecological or biological response to some critical level of disturbance.
   Alternative definitions are premised on different trajectories of
   response or a direct recognition of conservation risks when prioritising
   socioeconomic values. Second, there is no clear or consistent method for
   identifying ecological thresholds including the appropriate response
   variables. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that ecological
   thresholds generalize to other species or populations: this limits the
   efficiency of thresholds as a decision making tool. Fourth, even where
   ecological thresholds are identified for the purpose of regulation or
   conservation planning, there are few examples of effective
   implementation. In comparison, regulatory limits are premised on the
   ecological response of populations to disturbance, but also consider the
   socioeconomic realities of conservation decision making including the
   risk associated with greater levels of development. Limits can be
   identified through participatory decision making processes that allow a
   consideration of potential future conditions within the context of
   current ecological and economic circumstances. When followed with
   long-term monitoring, regulatory limits can improve existing or provide
   new avenues for conservation planning and regulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Multiple threats and stressors to the Athabasca River Basin: What do we
   know so far?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {649},
Pages = {640-651},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Over the last five decades, the Athabasca River Basin in Alberta,
   Canada, has been subjected to a wide range of environmental stressors
   from diverse human developments. This has resulted in an escalation of
   government, academic, industry and community-based monitoring and
   research efforts. However, despite all the attention received, a
   comprehensive synthesis of what has been studied is lacking, in
   particular, in relation to the efforts examining single versus multiple
   stressors. Based on a systematic literature review, we found 386
   publications from 1969 to 2018 on the Athabasca River focusing on single
   stressors (68.4\%) compared to multiple stressors (31.6\%). There was a
   significant shift in the focus of studies between the 1990s and present
   from assessing threats of pulp and paper developments to those related
   to oil sands activities, with studies most predominantly addressing
   chemical stressors. Despite these efforts, there remain significant
   knowledge gaps regarding the cumulative effects of multiple stressors,
   particularly on biological and ecological endpoints. Correspondingly, a
   wide range of contradictory conclusions were reported regarding the
   ecological, regulatory and societal significance of the reported
   environmental impacts, highlighting both the complexity and often lack
   of standardization of approaches used. This emphasizes the need for
   improved integration of monitoring and research activities that are
   hypothesis driven, have clear objectives, and are better aligned with
   environmental management processes and decisions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Quantifying biodiversity trade-offs in the face of widespread renewable

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {The challenge of balancing biodiversity protection with economic growth
   is epitomized by the development of renewable and unconventional energy,
   whose adoption is aimed at stemming the impacts of global climate
   change, yet has outpaced our understanding of biodiversity impacts. We
   evaluated the potential conflict between biodiversity protection and
   future electricity generation from renewable (wind farms, run-of-river
   hydro) and non-renewable (shale gas) sources in British Columbia (BC),
   Canada using three metrics: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electricity
   cost, and overlap between future development and conservation priorities
   for several fish and wildlife groups - small-bodied vertebrates, large
   mammals, freshwater fish - and undisturbed landscapes. Sharp trade-offs
   in global versus regional biodiversity conservation exist for all energy
   technologies, and in BC they are currently smallest for wind energy: low
   GHG emissions, low-moderate overlap with top conservation priorities,
   and competitive energy cost. GHG emissions from shale gas are 1000 times
   higher than those from renewable sources, and run-of-river hydro has
   high overlap with conservation priorities for small-bodied vertebrates.
   When all species groups were considered simultaneously, run-of-river
   hydro had moderate overlap (0.56), while shale gas and onshore wind had
   low overlap with top conservation priorities (0.23 and 0.24,
   respectively). The unintended cost of distributed energy sources for
   regional biodiversity suggest that trade-offs based on more diverse
   metrics must be incorporated into energy planning.},

Title = {Managing human footprint to achieve large-landscape conservation
   outcomes: Establishing density limits on motorized route-user networks
   in Alberta's Eastern Slopes},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relationships between human footprint and measurable impacts to
   biodiversity and ecosystems are complex. Also problematic is the
   hesitancy to derive threshold-based management tools from the scientific
   literature. Road ecology points to road densities as a useful surrogate
   for human footprint, and the research is replete with links between
   cumulative effects and various density thresholds. Yet there are few
   practical examples demonstrating how to go about managing the cumulative
   effects to biodiversity and how to reduce human footprint for
   large-landscape conservation.
   In Alberta's Eastern Slopes, a sub-regional planning process resulted in
   regulatory density limits being deployed on public lands in the
   Livingstone-Porcupine Hills. The density limits are applied to two
   classes of motorized route-use - open public use and restricted use by
   statutory consent holders - and are informed by biodiversity modeling
   analysis. Several elements supported the establishment of these density
   limits including a robust regional planning framework, legislative and
   regulatory tools, and thorough community engagement and participation in
   the planning process. Implementation success depends on resources for
   operational management, education, enforcement, monitoring, and
   restoration. We examine the Livingstone-Porcupine Hills Land Footprint
   Management Plan as an example of a real-world approach to manage a
   common and growing problem. We demonstrate that there is sufficient
   scientific literature to support a conceptual framework for motorized
   route-user networks, and that real-world applications in threshold-based
   decision-making have practical merit. Density limits on motorized
   route-user networks constitute a viable cumulative effects management
   tool, especially for land managers seeking to maintain biodiversity and
   healthy ecosystems on large unprotected landscapes. (C) 2019 The

Title = {The Social Dimensions of Sustainability and Change in Diversified
   Farming Systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Agricultural systems are embedded in wider social-ecological processes
   that must be considered in any complete discussion of sustainable
   agriculture. Just as climatic profiles will influence the future
   viability of crops, institutions, i.e., governance agreements, rural
   household and community norms, local associations, markets, and
   agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that
   foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural
   sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we
   propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i.e., human health,
   labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural
   diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on
   institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A
   comparative analysis of case studies from California's Central Valley,
   Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union
   agricultural parks finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within
   and among these systems and interdependent with institutional
   environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices.
   Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers'
   cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence
   agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more
   `sustainable' products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers
   organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they
   promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are
   inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability.
   The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe's
   peri-urban agricultural parks show unexpected potential for promoting
   DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated
   against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria,
   short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a
   valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits
   in the medium and long terms.},

Title = {A heuristic tool to assess regional impacts of renewable energy
   infrastructure on conservation areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {263},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wind and hydropower are important renewable components of national
   energy portfolios, but their infrastructure negatively affects
   biodiversity. Regional development requires identification of scenarios
   that minimize the cumulative impacts of multiple facilities. We
   introduce the cumulative impact plot (CIP) to quantify cumulative
   impacts of renewable energy development within a region. Summed impacts
   of facilities are plotted as a function of the number of facilities,
   with facilities ranked by increasing (the best-case scenario) or
   decreasing (worst-case scenario) individual impact. These curves
   represent lower and upper bounds to which alternative development
   scenarios (e.g., facilities ranked by generating capacity) can be
   compared. We used CIPs to assess overlap of potential wind and
   hydropower facilities with two types of conservation area in the United
   States: (1) federally protected lands and (2) critical habitats of
   federally threatened and endangered species. We evaluated two
   alternative scenarios: facilities ranked by (A) decreasing generating
   capacity and (B) increasing distance from urban centers. Differences
   between the best-case and worst-case scenarios were large, thus
   revealing opportunities to develop facilities with limited impact on
   conservation areas. Alternative scenarios maximizing energy density
   generally resulted in conservation area overlap intermediate to
   best-case and worst-case scenarios. CIPs can also identify the
   proportion of wind versus hydropower favored under alternative
   scenarios. Build-out scenarios aimed at minimizing conservation area
   overlap favor hydropower, whereas alternative scenarios favor wind
   power. We conclude that CIPs can (1) complement-but should not
   replace-project-level environmental impact assessment, (2) integrate
   strategic, cumulative, and scenario-based assessments, and (3) harness
   rapidly growing geospatial data.},

Title = {Modeling contamination conditions in small-scale industrial areas to
   estimate health savings benefits associated with remediation},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mercury and dioxin pollution associated with the China Petrochemical
   Development Corporation's An-shun plant is one of the most severe soil
   contamination incidents in Taiwan's history. Residents living nearby
   were exposed to heavy metals and dioxins that led to significant impacts
   on human health and safety. While many studies related to contamination
   in large-scale industrial areas have been conducted to evaluate the
   effects of occupational contaminant exposure, studies related to people
   who live near small-scale industry areas are less common. In this study,
   we use the system dynamics modeling to build a media flow pattern for
   mercury and dioxin in the vicinity of the An-shun plant, simulate the
   concentrations of the pollutants before and after remediation, and
   compare the simulated values with the measurements of actual conditions
   after remediation to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the model.
   This study also estimated the concentration of mercury and dioxin in
   each food medium to simulate the daily exposure of the human body to
   these contaminants. Finally, the reduction in mercury and dioxin levels
   in the study area was used to estimate the total health benefits to the
   local population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   application of this methodology to small-scale industrial areas as well
   as improve the decision-making process before, during, and after
   remediation of contaminated sites. The results of this study revealed
   the health benefits to residents living in the Annan District after
   remediation was completed at the An-shun plant were significant.},

Title = {Fear and stressing in predator prey ecology: considering the twin
   stressors of predators and people on mammals},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {Predators induce stress in prey and can have beneficial effects in
   ecosystems, but can also have negative effects on biodiversity if they
   are overabundant or have been introduced. The growth of human
   populations is, at the same time, causing degradation of natural
   habitats and increasing interaction rates of humans with wildlife, such
   that conservation management routinely considers the effects of human
   disturbance as tantamount to or surpassing those of predators. The need
   to simultaneously manage both of these threats is particularly acute in
   urban areas that are, increasingly, being recognized as global hotspots
   of wildlife activity. Pressures from altered predator-prey interactions
   and human activity may each initiate fear responses in prey species
   above those that are triggered by natural stressors in ecosystems. If
   fear responses are experienced by prey at elevated levels, on top of
   responses to multiple environmental stressors, chronic stress impacts
   may occur. Despite common knowledge of the negative effects of stress,
   however, it is rare that stress management is considered in
   conservation, except in intensive ex situ situations such as in captive
   breeding facilities or zoos. We propose that mitigation of stress
   impacts on wildlife is crucial for preserving biodiversity, especially
   as the value of habitats within urban areas increases. As such, we
   highlight the need for future studies to consider fear and stress in
   predator-prey ecology to preserve both biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning, especially in areas where human disturbance occurs. We
   suggest, in particular, that non-invasive in situ investigations of
   endocrinology and ethology be partnered in conservation planning with
   surveys of habitat resources to incorporate and reduce the effects of
   fear and stress on wildlife.},

Title = {An analysis of the state of impact assessment research for low carbon
   power production: Building a better understanding of information and
   knowledge gaps},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {116-128},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study provides a portrait of the state of impact assessment (IA)
   research for four types of low carbon power production (wind, solar,
   small-scale hydro and small modular nuclear reactors). The emphasis is
   on IA research that has relevance to the Canadian policy setting. The
   method involved a systematized scan of the academic literature (peer
   reviewed publications, conference proceedings and book chapters) and
   reports and studies produced by government and other organizations. The
   literature was categorized according to a framework adapted from
   transition theory. The results indicate that the literature addressing
   wind power is comprehensive, but there is a relative scarcity of
   research (in both quantity and breadth) on the impacts of solar,
   small-scale hydro, and small modular reactors (SMRs). In each of these
   three energy areas there is a lack of available work addressing the
   social, political and cultural impacts accompanied by more specialized
   gaps in the biophysical research. Drawing on a transition theory
   typology, the majority of the literature can be characterized as
   reflexive, with less than 20\% of research exploring primarily
   operational, tactical, or strategic themes. But there are many sources
   where the research contains overlapping categories. The research for SMR
   impacts is distinct from the other three alternative power sources; this
   literature is largely strategic. Priorities for further analysis in the
   short-term include applying lessons from the international literature to
   the Canadian context and developing a better understanding of the
   specific impacts of alternative energy sources on Indigenous
   communities. In the longer term, there is a need for more research in
   the field, with a particular emphasis on understanding the operational
   and strategic qualifies of low carbon power production.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {72},
Number = {5},
Pages = {785-795},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {River networks are connected in both upstream and downstream directions
   on large spatial scales by movement of water, materials, and animals.
   Here I examine the implications of these linkages for the stability,
   productivity, and management of watersheds and their migratory fishes. I
   use simple simulations of watershed alteration to illustrate that
   degradation can erode the productivity and stability of both upstream
   and downstream fisheries. Through analysis of an existing global dataset
   on rivers, I found that larger rivers tend to be more fragmented than
   smaller rivers. I offer three challenges and opportunities for the
   future management of watersheds. First, given that human impacts can
   spread up and down rivers, there is a need to align the scales of impact
   assessments with the natural scale of river systems. Second,
   free-flowing rivers naturally dampen variability; thus, the conservation
   of connectivity, habitat, and biodiversity represents a key opportunity
   to sustain the processes that confer stability. Third, watersheds
   represent natural units of social-ecological systems; watershed
   governance would facilitate reciprocal feedbacks between people and
   ecosystems and enable more social-ecological resilience.},

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {26},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Mining provides resources for people but can pose risks to ecosystems
   that support cultural keystone species. Our synthesis reviews relevant
   aspects of mining operations, describes the ecology of salmonid-bearing
   watersheds in northwestern North America, and compiles the impacts of
   metal and coal extraction on salmonids and their habitat. We
   conservatively estimate that this region encompasses nearly 4000 past
   producing mines, with present-day operations ranging from small placer
   sites to massive open-pit projects that annually mine more than 118
   million metric tons of earth. Despite impact assessments that are
   intended to evaluate risk and inform mitigation, mines continue to harm
   salmonid-bearing watersheds via pathways such as toxic contaminants,
   stream channel burial, and flow regime alteration. To better maintain
   watershed processes that benefit salmonids, we highlight key windows
   during the mining governance life cycle for science to guide policy by
   more accurately accounting for stressor complexity, cumulative effects,
   and future environmental change.},

Abstract = {Phthalates are anti-androgenic chemicals and may cause long-lasting
   adverse effects on growing fetuses. Understanding their exposure profile
   during pregnancy, therefore, is of public health importance. Because
   both behavioral and physiological changes of pregnant women are expected
   to be substantial, the amount of phthalate exposure is expected to vary
   significantly over the course of pregnancy. Temporal trend of phthalate
   exposure during pregnancy, however, is largely unknown, especially in
   Asian women. The purpose of this study is to investigate the urinary
   concentrations of metabolites for major phthalates and alternative
   plasticizers over the course of pregnancy among Korean (n = 81) and Thai
   women (n = 102). Twenty-four metabolites from 15 plasticizers, such as
   dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isobutyl phthalate
   (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP),
   di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dioctyl phthalate (DnOP), diisononyl
   phthalate (DiNP), diisodecyl phthalate (DiDP), di(2-ethylhexyl)
   terephthalate (DEHTP), and di-(iso-nonyl)-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate
   (DINCH), were measured in urine samples collected in each trimester from
   pregnant women. While the levels of several phthalate metabolites were
   significantly different by trimester among Korean women, those of Thai
   women were relatively consistent. Urinary metabolites of DEP and DnOP
   were higher in Thai pregnant women compared to Korean pregnant women.
   The detection frequencies of the DINCH metabolite were 67.4\% and 44.9\%
   among Korean and Thai pregnant women, respectively. However, the ratio
   of DINCH to DEHP metabolites was significantly higher in Thai women.
   According to risk assessment, 11.9\% of Korean and 5.3\% of Thai women
   were considered at risk due to phthalate exposure, and DEHP, DnBP and
   DiBP were identified as major risk drivers. Considering the
   vulnerability of growing fetuses, further studies are warranted to
   identify major sources of exposure to these plasticizers during
   pregnancy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of phthalate acid esters
   (PAEs) make their impact on the environment a matter of considerable
   concern. Due to China's recent economic development and population
   growth, it has become one of the largest manufacturers and consumers of
   PAEs, with an associated contamination threat to several environmental
   compartments. The aim of this overview is to present a systematic
   account of PAE occurrence in various environmental media in China in the
   last decade, including the air, surface water, sediments, soil, sewage,
   and sludge; human exposure to PAEs is also evaluated. This reveals a
   location-dependence that can be attributed to regional differences in
   economic and industrial development as well as specific geographic
   location. A need for further study into the transportation and
   transformation behavior of PAEs in different environmental media and
   into PAE control technologies is identified, as a means of effectively
   assessing potential ecological and health risks. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs), phthalate
   metabolites (mPAFs), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the
   urine of school children aged 8-11 years from Shenzhen, China were
   measured in order to investigate oxidative stress damage from
   co-exposure to PAHs and PAEs. The concentrations of OH-PAHs and mPAEs in
   urine were 0.36-36.5 (median: 3.86) and 9.48-1609 (median: 240) ng/mL
   respectively. Gender and age did not influence urinary concentrations of
   Sigma OH-PAHs and EmPAEs, but geographical variations (i.e., urban
   versus suburban) were observed. Levels of 8-OHdG were positively
   correlated with urinary OH-PAHs and mPAEs, with correlation coefficients
   (r) varying between 0.160 and 0.365 (p < 0.05). OH-PAHs made a greater
   contribution to oxidative DNA damage than mPAFs when these two types of
   pollutants were present at the same concentrations. Human health risks
   were assessed using the hazard quotient and the hazard index for the
   cumulative risk of a complex of chemicals. The results demonstrated that
   risks from PAHs could be neglected, but that 29.5 \% of school children
   may be subject to obvious health risks from PAEs, especially
   diethylhexyl phthalate.},

Title = {Mother/child organophosphate and pyrethroid distributions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The present study reports one of the few cases in which organophosphate
   (OP) and pyrethroid (PYR) pesticide human exposure is evaluated in
   family contexts by the analysis of mother/child pair samples. Urinary
   concentrations of 6 organic metabolites of organophosphates and 2
   pyrethroids were measured in mothers and their 7-to 8-year-old children
   (n = 168) in a general population from the central area of Slovenia. The
   results were adjusted for specific gravity and creatinine.
   The most abundant OP metabolite in children was 4-nitrophenol (PNP)
   (median 0.7 ng/ml) and in mothers (0.45 ng/ml), representing parathion
   exposure. 3-Phenoxibenzoic acid (3-PBA) (0.26 ng/ml), the general
   metabolite of pyrethroids, and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY) (0.16
   ng/ml; chlorpyriphos) were the second most abundant compounds in
   children and mothers, respectively. The geometric mean specific gravity
   adjusted concentrations of OPs and PYRs were statistically significantly
   higher in children than in their mothers (between 3\% and 24\% higher),
   with the exception of TCPY (26\% lower). All OP and PYR metabolites
   found in higher concentration in children showed significant positive
   correlations with the metabolite concentrations found in the mothers (p
   < 0.05 and 0.01), involving the fact that higher maternal concentrations
   were associated with higher children levels.
   These differential mother-children distributions and significant
   correlations were observed for the 2 types of pesticides studied, OPs
   and PYRs, which have different chemical properties. This agreement is
   consistent with the incorporation of the pesticides because of the
   general activities developed in the family context, instead of
   pesticide-dependent specific inputs.
   Comparison of the estimated daily intakes with the acceptable daily
   intakes of all detected metabolites revealed no significant risk of
   adverse health effects from exposure to these pesticides.},

Abstract = {Consumers might be simultaneously exposed to several pesticide residues
   contained in their food. Based on the results of previous studies, 20
   pesticides were selected due to their high exposure levels to which the
   Chinese population is likely exposed through the diet. The purpose of
   this study was to measure the cytotoxicity of these pesticides in HepG2
   cells in vitro, as an alternative approach to assess the toxicity of
   chemicals. Then, the pesticides and some of the mixtures with
   comparatively high cell-proliferating inhibitory activities were
   selected to test the cellular ROS level and apoptosis-related protein
   Caspase-3/7 content in HepG2 cells. The combined effects of these
   pesticide mixtures with the prediction was based on a combination index
   (CI)-isobologram equation and the pesticide combinations exhibited
   various types of interactions (synergism, antagonism, and additivity).
   Two individuals, one binary combinations, and three uniform design (UD)
   mixtures of the pesticides were found to have significant cytotoxic
   effects, along with significant time- and dose-dependent induction of
   caspase-3/7 activity in vitro, indicating that cytotoxicity caused by
   these pesticides might be attributed to the pro-oxidative and apoptosis
   induced potential. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs) are widely used in consumer and industrial
   products and may thus pose significant health risks. Urine analysis,
   which has usually been applied to assess the health risks of PAEs, has
   the drawback of small sample sizes and insufficient representativeness.
   Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) collects wastewater samples
   containing urine from the entire community and thus is more
   representative than urine samples. In this work, exposure levels and
   health risks of PAEs were estimated on a national scale for the first
   time through the WBE approach. Wastewater samples were collected from 54
   wastewater treatment plants in 27 major cities that cover all of the
   geographic regions of China. The estimated Sigma 5PAEs exposure levels
   ranged from 290 mu g/inh/d (Lhasa) to 3642 +/- 467 mu g/inh/d
   (Zhengzhou) with a mean level of 2184 +/- 1173 mu g/inh/d. Di-n-butyl
   phthalate accounted for the highest proportion (65\%) in the total
   exposure level. The Sigma 5PAEs exposure levels in Southwest China were
   significantly lower than those in other regions due to the low
   production and consumption of plastics in the region. The health risks
   of PAEs were assessed by comparing the estimated daily exposure levels
   to the acceptable daily exposure levels. For adults, the hazard index
   that represents cumulative risk of PAEs was above or below 1 depending
   on a particular reference dose (total daily intake values or the
   reference dose for anti-androgenicity) that was used for risk
   calculation. In contrast, the hazard index was above 1 for a significant
   number of cities for children, regardless of which reference dose was
   used. The results indicate that health risks of PAE exposure in China
   cannot be overlooked. Children in China are under considerably greater
   risks than adults, which warrants further research or proper regulation
   of PAE use in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an omnipresent environmental
   chemical with widespread nonoccupational human exposure through multiple
   ways. Although considerable efforts have been invested to investigate
   mechanisms of DEHP toxicity, the key metabolic biomarkers of DEHP
   toxicity remain to be identified. The aim of this study was to assess
   the urinary metabonomics of dietary DEHP in rats using the technique of
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem
   mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Fourteen female Wistar rats were
   divided into two groups and given increasing dietary doses of DEHP for
   30 consecutive days. The urinary metabolite profile was studied using
   ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole
   time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) enabled
   clusters to be clearly separated. Eleven principal urinary metabolites
   were identified as contributing to the clusters. The clusters in the
   positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode were xanthurenic acid,
   kynurenic acid, nonate, N6-methyladenosine, and L-isoleucyl-L-proline.
   The clusters in the negative ESI mode were hippuric acid,
   tetrahydrocortisol, citric acid, phenylpropionylglycine, cPA(18:2(9Z,
   12Z)/0:0), and LysoPC(14:1(9Z)). The urinary metabonomic changes
   indicated that exposure to dietary DEHP can affect energy-related
   metabolism, liver and renal function, fatty acid metabolism, and cause
   DNA damage in rats. The findings of this study on the urinary
   metabolites and metabolic pathways of DEHP may form the basis for future
   studies on the mechanisms of toxicity of this commonly found
   environmental chemical.},

Abstract = {Although previous studies showed that children are widely exposed to
   phthalates, the sources of phthalate exposure for school-aged children
   in China are not well understood. This study aimed to assess phthalate
   metabolite levels and explore the factors influencing exposure in
   children. We collected demographic data and biological samples from 336
   children aged. 6-12 years. We calculated urinary concentrations of 14
   mono-phthalate metabolites and conducted chi-square (chi(2)) tests and
   logistic regression analysis to determine the variables associated with
   phthalate levels. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and
   mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were the most abundant
   urinary phthalate metabolites. In addition, housing type, decorating
   materials in the home, and frequency of canned food consumption were
   associated with, exposure to low molecular weight phthalates. Water
   source, duration of time spent playing with toys, residential area, and
   frequency of canned food consumption were associated with exposure to
   high molecular weight phthalates. Based an these results, potential
   strategies to reduce exposure to phthalates include avoiding plastic
   food containers and chemical fragrances as well as eating fewer
   processed foods, especially canned foods, and foods in plastic
   packaging. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Concerns about the possible negative impacts of current use pesticides
   (CUPs) for both the environment and human health have increased
   worldwide. However, the knowledge on the occurrence of CUPs in soil and
   air and the related human exposure in Africa is limited. This study
   investigated the presence of 30 CUPs in soil and air at two distinct
   agricultural sites in South Africa and estimated the human exposure and
   related risks to rural residents via soil ingestion and inhalation
   (using hazard quotients, hazard index and relative potency factors). We
   collected 12 soil and 14 air samples over seven days during the main
   pesticide application season in 2018. All samples were extracted,
   purified and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled
   with tandem mass spectrometry. In soils, nine CUPs were found, with
   chlorpyrifos, carbaryl and tebuconazole having the highest
   concentrations (up to 63.6, 1.10 and 0.212 ng g-1, respectively). In
   air, 16 CUPs were found, with carbaryl, tebuconazole and terbuthylazine
   having the highest levels (up to 25.0, 22.2 and 1.94 pg m-3,
   respectively). Spatial differences were observed between the two sites
   for seven CUPs in air and two in soils. A large dominance towards the
   particulate phase was found for almost all CUPs, which could be related
   to mass transport kinetics limitations (non-equilibrium) following
   pesticide application. The estimated daily intake via soil ingestion and
   inhalation of individual pesticides ranged from 0.126 fg kg-1 day-1
   (isoproturon) to 14.7 ng kg-1 day-1 (chlorpyrifos). Except for
   chlorpyrifos, soil ingestion generally represented a minor exposure
   pathway compared to inhalation (i.e. <5\%). The pesticide environmental
   exposure largely differed between the residents of the two distinct
   agricultural sites in terms of levels and composition. The estimated
   human health risks due to soil inges-tion and inhalation of pesticides
   were negligible although future studies should explore other relevant
   pathways. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Abstract = {Some phthalates, which are used mainly as plasticizers, are suspected to
   be endocrine disruptors. In the present study, daily intakes of
   phthalates by Japanese children through all exposure pathways and the
   contribution of indoor air quality to the intakes were examined by
   measuring urinary phthalate metabolites in the children and the airborne
   phthalates in their residences. Spot urine samples excreted first after
   waking up in the morning were collected from the subjects aged 6 to 15
   years (n = 132), and airborne phthalates were sampled in the subjects'
   bedrooms for 24 h. Eight airborne phthalates and their urinary
   metabolites were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The
   daily intakes of the phthalates estimated were as follows (median, mu
   g/kg b.w./day): dimethyl phthalate (DMP), 0.15; diethyl phthalate (DEP),
   0.42; diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), 1.1; di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP),
   2.2; dicyclohexyl phthalate (DcHP), 0.026; benzylbutyl phthalate (BBzP),
   0.032; di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), 6.3. The 95th percentile (21
   mu g/kg b.w./day) of the DEHP intakes exceeded the reference doses (RfD,
   20 mu g/kg b.w./day) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
   DEHP was suggested to be the most notable phthalate from the perspective
   of adverse effects on the health of Japanese children. On the other
   hand, DcHP and di-n-hexyl phthalate were not considered to be very
   important as indoor air pollutants and as internal contaminants for the
   children. The contribution rates of the amounts absorbed by inhalation
   to the amounts absorbed via all of the exposure pathways were only 7.9,
   4.4, 6.6, 3.2, 0.22, and 1.0\% as the median for DMP, DEP, DiBP, DnBP,
   BBzP, and DEHP, respectively. Therefore, inhalation did not seem to
   contribute very much as an absorption pathway of the phthalates for
   Japanese children while at home.},

Abstract = {Given the serious adverse health effects associated with many
   pollutants, and the inequitable distribution of these effects between
   socioeconomic groups, air pollution is often a focus of environmental
   justice (EJ) research. However, EJ analyses that aim to illuminate
   whether and how air pollution hazards are inequitably distributed may
   present a unique set of requirements for estimating pollutant
   concentrations compared to other air quality applications. Here, we
   perform a scoping review of the range of data analytic and modeling
   methods applied in past studies of air pollution and environmental
   injustice and develop a guidance framework for selecting between them
   given the purpose of analysis, users, and resources available. We
   include proxy, monitor-based, statistical, and process-based methods.
   Upon critically synthesizing the literature, we identify four main
   dimensions to inform method selection: accuracy, interpretability,
   spatiotemporal features of the method, and usability of the method. We
   illustrate the guidance framework with case studies from the literature.
   Future research in this area includes an exploration of increasing data
   availability, advanced statistical methods, and the importance of
   science-based policy.},

Title = {Investigation of phthalate metabolites in urine and daily phthalate
   intakes among three age groups in Beijing, China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {260},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phthalates are widely used as binders and plasticizers in industrial and
   consumer products but show diverse toxicity. We investigated the level
   of human exposure to phthalates in Beijing, one of the most densely
   populated cities in the world. In this study, 12 metabolites of
   phthalates were measured in 70 spot urine samples collected from Beijing
   residents from August 2017 to April 2018 using ultra highperformance
   liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found that
   metabolites of phthalates were ubiquitous in all urine samples. Total
   concentrations of phthalate metabolites ranged from 39.6 to 1931 ng
   mL(-1), with median concentrations were in decreasing order of children
   (371 ng mL(-1))> younger adults (332 ng mL(-1))> older adults (276 ng
   mL(-1)). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was the predominant compound, and
   occurred at concentrations greater than those reported for people in
   other countries. The mean values of estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of
   Sigma phthalate were 35.2, 10.3 and 10.9 ng (kg-bm)(-1) d(-1 )for
   children, younger adults and older adults, respectively. EDIs of
   di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-iso-butyl phthalate (DiBP) and
   di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exceeded reference values suggested
   by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the European Food Safety
   Authority. When concentrations were normalized to volume or
   creatinine-adjusted, hazard quotients (HQs) for 40 of 70 participants
   exhibited larger HQs >1 for individual phthalates, which was indicative
   of potential for adverse effects. Thus, exposure to phthalates might be
   a critical factor contributing to adverse health effects in Beijing
   residents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
   establish a pre-baseline level of urinary phthalate metabolites among
   residents in Beijing. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Urinary concentrations of 25 phthalate metabolites in Brazilian children
   and their association with oxidative DNA damage},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Exposure of humans to phthalates has received considerable attention due
   to the ubiquitous occurrence and potential adverse health effects of
   these chemicals. Nevertheless, little is lcnown about the exposure of
   the Brazilian population to phthalates. In this study, concentrations of
   25 phthalate metabolites were determined in urine samples collected from
   300 Brazilian children (6-14 years old). Further, the association
   between urinary phthalate concentrations and a biomarker of oxidative
   stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHDG), was examined. Overall,
   eleven phthalate metabolites Were found in at least 95\% of the samples
   analyzed. The highest median concentrations were found for monoethyl
   phthalate (mEP; 573 ng mL(-1)), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate
   (mECPP; 52.8 ng mono-isobutyl phthalate (mIBP; 43.8 ng mL(-1)), and
   mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP; 42.4 ng mL(-1)). The secondary metabolites
   of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and mEP, mIBP, and mBP were the
   most abundant compounds, accounting for >90\% of the total
   concentrations. On the basis of the measured concentrations of urinary
   phthalate metabolites, we estimated daily intakes of the parent
   phthalates, which were 0.3, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, and 7.2 mu g/kg-bw/day for
   dimethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, diethyl
   phthalate, and DEHP, respectively. Approximately one-quarter of the
   Brazilian children had a hazard index of >1 for phthalate exposures.
   Statistically significant positive associations were found between 8OHDG
   and the concentration of the sum of phthalate metabolites, sum of DEHP
   metabolites, mEP, mIBP, mBP, monomethyl phthalate, mono
   (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, monocarboxyoctyl
   phthalate, monocarboxynonyl phthalate, monoisopentyl phthalate, and
   mono-n-propyl phthalate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study to report the exposure of a Brazilian population to phthalates.

Abstract = {Researches on associations between phthalates exposure and child
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are inconsistent. This
   study aimed to evaluate the associations of urinary phthalates with
   ADHD, co-occurring oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), related symptoms
   and behavior problems among Chinese children. We enrolled 225 ADHD cases
   and 225 healthy controls aged 6-13 years old in Liuzhou, China. Each
   child provided repeated urine samples at 4 visits. Eight phthalate
   metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and
   tandem mass spectrometry. Child ADHD symptoms and related behaviors were
   assessed using Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV scale and child
   behavior checklist. Higher urinary concentrations of
   mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)
   phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP) were
   dose-dependently associated with ADHD {[}odds ratios (ORs) ranged from
   2.35 to 3.04 for the highest vs. the lowest tertile] and co-occurring
   ODD (ORs ranged from 3.27 to 4.44 for the highest vs. the lowest
   tertile) in the multivariable logistic regression models (all p for
   trend <= 0.01), which were consistent with positive trends of increased
   scores of inattention domain, hyperactive domain and ODD symptoms (all p
   for trend <= 0.01). Besides, the monomethyl phthalate (MMP)
   concentration was associated with higher scores of inattention domain
   and ODD symptoms (both p < 0.05). Additionally, the MEHHP, MEOHP and
   MEHP concentrations were related to child attention problems, aggressive
   behaviors and externalizing behaviors (all p < 0.05). We also observed
   positive associations of the MEHP concentration with depressed behaviors
   and internalizing behaviors (all p < 0.05). Our results indicate that
   child exposure to phthalates may contribute to ADHD, ODD and
   externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {Indoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals,
   including many compounds with known or suspected health effects.
   However, most dust exposure studies measure few chemicals in small
   samples. We systematically searched the U.S. indoor dust literature on
   phthalates, replacement flame retardants (RFRs), perfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs), synthetic fragrances, and environmental phenols and
   estimated pooled geometric means (GMs), and 95\% confidence intervals
   for 45 chemicals measured in >= 3 data sets. In order to rank and
   contextualize these results, we used the pooled GMs to calculate
   residential intake from dust ingestion, inhalation, and dermal uptake
   from air, and then identified hazard traits from the Safer Consumer
   Products Candidate Chemical List. Our results indicate that U.S. indoor
   dust consistently contains chemicals from multiple classes. Phthalates
   occurred in the highest concentrations, followed by phenols, RFRs,
   fragrance, and PFASs. Several phthalates and RFRs had the highest
   residential intakes. We also found that many chemicals, in dust share
   hazard traits such as reproductive and endocrine toxicity. We offer
   recommendations to maximize comparability of studies and advance indoor
   exposure science. This information is critical in shaping future
   exposure and health studies, especially related to cumulative exposures,
   and in providing evidence for intervention development and public
   policy.},

   assay (direct TOP assay (dTOP)) that works without prior extraction.
   Target analysis determined Sigma PFAS concentrations in bream livers of
   8.7-282 mu g kg(-1) wet weight (ww) in 2019, with highest contaminations
   in the Rhine and lower Elbe. In bream fillet, concentrations were lower
   (<0.5-10.6 mu g kg(-1) Sigma PFAS). Contamination of suspended
   particulate matter (SPM) was highest in the upper Elbe downstream the
   Czech border (5.5 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (dw) in 2018). Herring gull
   eggs from the North and Baltic Seas showed Sigma PFAS levels around
   53.0-69.6 mu g kg(-1) ww in 2019. In soil, concentrations ranged between
   <0.5 and 4.6 mu g kg(-1) dw with highest levels in the Dueben Heath near
   Leipzig and the low mountain range Solling. PFOS dominated in most
   samples. Of the targeted precursors, only FOSA, EtFOSAA, MeFOSAA,
   6:2-FtS and 6:2 diPAP were found. Replacement chemicals (ADONA, HFPO-DA,
   F-53B) were not detected.
   The dTOP assay revealed that considerable amounts of precursors were
   present at most riverine sampling sites. Particularly high precursor
   concentrations were observed in samples from the Upper Elbe at the Czech
   border and the Upper and Middle Rhine. In herring gull eggs and most
   soil samples, though, concentrations of precursors were low. Time trend
   analysis showed decreasing trends for most detected PFAS since 2005. In
   SPM, however, C4-C6 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids seem to increase
   indicating growing use of precursors based on shorter fluorinated
   chains.
   The results demonstrate that target analysis detects only a minor
   fraction of the PFAS burdens in environmental samples. The dTOP assay
   can support risk assessment and chemical monitoring with more
   comprehensive exposure data of the actual contamination. (C) 2021 The

Title = {Contributions of a Child's Built, Natural, and Social Environments to
   Their General Cognitive Ability: A Systematic Scoping Review},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {The etiology of a child's cognitive ability is complex, with research
   suggesting that it is not attributed to a single determinant or even a
   defined period of exposure. Rather, cognitive development is the product
   of cumulative interactions with the environment, both negative and
   positive, over the life course. The aim of this systematic scoping
   review was to collate evidence associated with children's cognitive
   health, including inherent factors as well as chemical and non-chemical
   stressors from the built, natural, and social environments. Three
   databases were used to identify recent epidemiological studies
   (2003-2013) that examined exposure factors associated with general
   cognitive ability in children. Over 100 factors were evaluated from 258
   eligible studies. We found that recent literature mainly assessed the
   hypothesized negative effects of either inherent factors or chemical
   exposures present in the physical environment. Prenatal growth, sleep
   health, lead and water pollutants showed consistent negative effects. Of
   the few studies that examined social stressors, results consistently
   showed cognitive development to be influenced by both positive and
   negative social interactions at home, in school or the community. Among
   behavioral factors related to diet and lifestyle choices of the mother,
   breastfeeding was the most studied, showing consistent positive
   associations with cognitive ability. There were mostly inconsistent
   results for both chemical and non-chemical stressors. The majority of
   studies utilized traditional exposure assessments, evaluating chemical
   and non-chemical stressors separately. Collective evidence from a
   limited number of studies revealed that cumulative exposure assessment
   that incorporates multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors over the
   life course may unravel the variability in effect on cognitive
   development and help explain the inconsistencies across studies. Future
   research examining the interactions of multiple stressors within a
   child's total environment, depicting a more real-world exposure, will
   aid in understanding the cumulative effects associated with a child's
   ability to learn.},

Title = {Effects of hypoxia-cadmium interactions on rainbow trout
   (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) mitochondrial bioenergetics: attenuation of
   hypoxia-induced proton leak by low doses of cadmium},

Abstract = {The goal of the present study was to elucidate the modulatory effects of
   cadmium (Cd) on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction
   in light of the limited understanding of the mechanisms of multiple
   stressor interactions in aquatic organisms. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) liver mitochondria were isolated and energized with complex I
   substrates (malate-glutamate), and exposed to hypoxia (0>P-O2<2 Torr)
   for 0-60 min followed by reoxygenation and measurement of coupled and
   uncoupled respiration and complex I enzyme activity. Thereafter, 5 min
   hypoxia was used to probe interactions with Cd (0-20 mu mol l(-1)) and
   to test the hypothesis that deleterious effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation
   on mitochondria were mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   Hypoxia/reoxygenation inhibited state 3 and uncoupler-stimulated (state
   3u) respiration while concomitantly stimulating states 4 and 4(ol)
   (proton leak) respiration, thus reducing phosphorylation and coupling
   efficiencies. Low doses of Cd (<= 5 mu mol l(-1)) reduced, while higher
   doses enhanced, hypoxia-stimulated proton leak. This was in contrast to
   the monotonic enhancement by Cd of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced
   reductions of state 3 respiration, phosphorylation efficiency and
   coupling. Mitochondrial complex I activity was inhibited by
   hypoxia/reoxygenation, hence confirming the impairment of at least one
   component of the electron transport chain (ETC) in rainbow trout
   mitochondria. Similar to the effect on state 4 and proton leak, low
   doses of Cd partially reversed the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced complex
   I activity inhibition. The ROS scavenger and sulfhydryl group donor
   N-acetylcysteine, administrated immediately prior to hypoxia exposure,
   reduced hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak without rescuing
   the inhibited state 3 respiration, suggesting that hypoxia/reoxygenation
   influences distinct aspects of mitochondria via different mechanisms.
   Our results indicate that hypoxia/reoxygenation impairs the ETC and
   sensitizes mitochondria to Cd via mechanisms that involve, at least in
   part, ROS. Moreover, we provide, for the first time in fish, evidence
   for a hormetic effect of Cd on mitochondrial bioenergetics - the
   attenuation of hypoxia/reoxygenation-stimulated proton leak and partial
   rescue of complex I inhibition by low Cd doses.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the incidence of lipid metabolism disorders in
   adolescents has gradually increased, and the effects of DEHP on lipid
   metabolism have received widespread attention. In this study, 463
   adolescents aged 16-19 years were enrolled as subjects. This study
   analyzed the associations between the urinary levels of DEHP metabolites
   (MEHP, MEOHP, MEHHP, MECPP, MCMHP, and n-ary sumation DEHP) and BMI,
   WHR, WtHR, VAI, LAP, the plasma levels of lipids (TC, TG, HDL-C, and
   LDL-C), and the peripheral blood leukocyte mRNA levels of SREBP-2,
   SR-BI, LDLR, and NR1H3. Animal experiments were performed to confirm and
   expand findings. Wistar rats were administered DEHP at 0, 5, 50, and 500
   mg/kg/d for 8 weeks. The serum and liver levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, and
   LDL-C, and the liver mRNA and protein levels of SREBP-2, SR-BI, LDLR,
   and NR1H3 were measured. The results showed that WHR, VAI, and LAP were
   significantly positively associated with the urinary levels of MECPP and
   n-ary sumation DEHP; the plasma HDL-C level was significantly negatively
   associated with the levels of MECPP, MCMHP and n-ary sumation DEHP; the
   peripheral blood leukocyte mRNA levels of SREBP-2, NR1H3, and LDLR were
   significantly positively correlated with the MCMHP level; and the SR-BI
   mRNA level was significantly positively correlated with the levels of
   MECPP and MCMHP in adolescents. Moreover, the results of animal
   experiments showed that DEHP exposure significantly increased the serum
   levels of TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C in 500 mg/kg/d group, as well as the
   liver levels of TC and HDL-C, up-regulated SREBP-2 mRNA and protein
   expression in 50 and 500 mg/kg/ d groups. DEHP exposure significantly
   down-regulated SR-BI and NR1H3 protein expression in the liver of the
   500 mg/kg/d group rats. Our findings indicate that DEHP exposure can
   affect lipid metabolism in adolescents by regulating the expression of
   lipid metabolism-related genes.},

Abstract = {This is a cross-sectional study with data and biological material
   collection from vineyard farmers in southern Brazil. An interview was
   carried out through a questionnaire developed according to the reference
   guide of the state government. Plasma and urine samples were screened
   for Aluminum, Chromium, Manganese, Copper, Nickel, Cobalt, Zinc,
   Arsenic, Selenium, Cadmium, Antimony, Barium, Mercury, Lead and Uranium,
   with a technique for fast determination of these elemental contents in
   biological material utilizing dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled
   mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis was used to identify
   associations between these elemental contents in biological samples and
   the information obtained from the interviews. The farmers showed some
   trace elements in plasma and urine at a higher concentration than
   unexposed populations from other studies. This study highlights recent
   findings of trace elements in biological material and their association
   with characteristics of pesticide use. In addition, it also contributes
   to the gap in the literature regarding trace elements content in plasma

Title = {Using biomarkers in sewage to monitor community-wide human health:

Abstract = {Timely assessment of the aggregate health of small-area human
   populations is essential for guiding the optimal investment of resources
   needed for preventing, avoiding, controlling, or mitigating exposure
   risks. Seeking those interventions yielding the greatest benefit with
   respect to allocation of resources is essential for making progress
   toward community sustainability, promoting social justice, and
   maintaining or improving health and well-being. More efficient
   approaches are needed for revealing cause-effect linkages between
   environmental stressors and human health and for measuring overall
   aggregate health of small-area populations. A new concept is presented -
   community health assessment via Sewage Chemical Information Mining
   (SCIM) - for quickly gauging overall, aggregate health status or trends
   for entire small-area populations. The approach - BioSCIM - would
   monitor raw sewage for specific biomarkers broadly associated with human
   disease, stress, or health. A wealth of untapped chemical information
   resides in raw sewage, a portion comprising human biomarkers of exposure
   and effects. BioSCIM holds potential for capitalizing on the presence of
   biomarkers in sewage for accomplishing any number of objectives. One of
   the many potential applications of BioSCIM could use various biomarkers
   of stress resulting from the collective excretion from all individuals
   in a local population. A prototype example is presented using a class of
   biomarkers that measures collective, systemic oxidative stress - the
   isoprostanes (prostaglandin-like free-radical catalyzed oxidation
   products from certain polyunsaturated fatty acids). Sampling and
   analysis of raw sewage hold great potential for quickly determining
   aggregate biomarker levels for entire communities. Presented are the
   basic principles of BioSCIM, together with its anticipated limitations,
   challenges, and potential applications in assessing community-wide
   health. Community health assessment via BioSCIM could allow rapid
   assessments and intercomparisons of health status among distinct
   populations, revealing hidden or emerging trends or disparities and
   aiding in evaluating correlations (or hypotheses) between stressor
   exposures and disease. Published by Elsevier B.V.},
