  abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency's Wetlands Research Program has developed the synoptic approach as a proposed method for assessing cumulative impacts to wetlands by providing both a general and a comprehensive view of the environment. It can also be applied more broadly to regional prioritization of environmental issues. The synoptic approach is a framework for making comparisons between landscape subunits, such as watersheds, ecoregions, or counties, thereby allowing cumulative impacts to be considered in management decisions, Because there is a lack of tools that can be used to address cumulative impacts within regulatory constraints, the synoptic approach was designed as a method that could make use of available information and best professional judgement. Thus, the approach is a compromise between the need for rigorous results and the need for timely information, It is appropriate for decision making when quantitative, accurate information is not available; the;cost of improving existing information or obtaining better information is high; the cost of a wrong answer is low, there is a high demand for the information; and the situation calls for setting priorities between multiple decisions versus optimizing for a single decision. The synoptic approach should be useful for resource managers because an assessment is timely, it can be completed within one to two years at relatively low cost, tested, and improved over time. An assessment can also be customized to specific needs, and the results are presented in mapped format. However, the utility of a synoptic assessment depends on how well knowledge of the environment is incorporated into the assessment, relevant to particular management questions.},

  abstract = {The cumulative impacts of human activities and natural disturbance are leading to loss and extinction of species, ecological communities and biocultural connections people have to those ecosystems. Exclusive and extractive western science methodologies often hinder the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge holders in cumulative effects assessments (CEAs), which can lead to regional conflict and ineffective assessment and management of cumulative effects.We offer our reflections on the development of a collaborative CEA process with the Kitasoo Xai'xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations in what is now known as the Central Coast of British Columbia. We designed our CEA around the guiding principles of respecting Indigenous sovereignty and regional autonomy, designing for trauma-informed approaches, and prioritizing inclusivity and reciprocity. We focused our efforts on identifying current and future pressures on species of the Nations' choice.We relied on expert elicitation and data-driven approaches to identify and map current and future cumulative impacts to predict their consequences for species' health. We used combinations of visualizations, numerical, oral and written materials to convey, elicit and share complex information with experts.We found a diversity of elicitation processes fostered the involvement of a variety of experts (e.g. Indigenous knowledge holders and Nation staff, regional biologists, Crown managers, tenure holders). We mapped over 90+ impacts to species in the region and after conversation and facilitated elicitation processes with over 50 knowledge holders, emerged with predictions for the consequences of seven plausible scenarios of future cumulative impacts for eight species as well as broad themes for the management of cumulative impacts to the lands and waters of the Nations with whom we collaborated. Our shared lessons can support researchers, planners, proponents, and Indigenous and colonial government agencies to conduct inclusive, collaborative and accessible CEAs that inform regional land and marine use planning.},

  abstract = {The Black Sea remains one of the most fragile marine systems globally. The six countries that share the coastline of this semi-enclosed sea have declared, through the Convention on Biological Diversity and regional conventions, their intention to conserve biodiversity and increase the coverage of the protected areas. However, currently only a small proportion of the marine area is under protection. Here, we spatially delineated priority conservation sites that could ensure species protection under the impact of different threats. We developed a cumulative risk index, incorporating anthropogenic pressures related to pollution and fisheries. We then combined this information with distribution data of marine species to apply a systematic conservation planning approach. We identified eleven key areas that cover 10\% of the Black Sea, the protection of which could attain realistic conservation targets. These sites are mainly located in neritic and coastal habitats, which also host a number of species that avoid the anoxic part of the ocean basin. The management and efficient protection of these key areas require international collaboration, representing the only way to alleviate the severe degradation of this sensitive, but valuable, marine system.},

  abstract = {Delineating priority areas for highly mobile marine megafauna represents a major challenge for conservation biology. To manage such areas, one must understand both their spatial properties (i.e., location, number, extent), and the level of exposure to a number of given pressures. Here, we used a combination of ensemble distribution models, field-based validation methods and a cumulative effect assessment to illustrate key foraging sites and risk hotspots for adult loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that foraging sites covered about 10\% of the neritic zone of the Mediterranean basin. We identified sites which are well recognized by scientists, but also other areas for which our knowledge on the potential importance is limited. The patterns of the habitat use generated by field data validated the accuracy of the distribution model. About one fifth of the foraging areas hosted in the Mediterranean could be considered as hotspots of risk, characterized by high or very high exposure to cumulative pressures. Our results suggest that management and conservation efforts should continue to be held at key, well-known foraging grounds of adult sea turtles (e.g., Northern Adriatic Sea, Tunisian Plateau) but there are several more potential sites (e.g., parts of the Aegean Sea and the Western Mediterranean) which deserve our attention in order to ensure viable populations.},

Drawing on the perspectives and experiences of Canadian EA practitioners, this paper explores options or drivers of change for improving project-based assessment to better tackle cumulative effects on biodiversity. An on-line survey was conducted with 40 professionals from the private sector, government departments/agencies, universities, and non-governmental organizations, examining the current challenges and opportunities regarding: CEA process for biodiversity; responsibilities for undertaking CEA tasks; resources to support and promote good CEA practice. In terms of process, there is shared understanding on: (i) the need of EA terms of reference to provide specific directions on CEA; (ii) CEA should capture both human and natural drivers of cumulative change; (iii) spatial boundaries for CEA should be based on ecological boundaries. There are dissenting views about: (i) whether CEA should consider all valued components (VCs) potentially affected by a project or only those for which residual effects are predicted; and (ii) delimitation of future temporal limits. In terms of responsibilities, participants agreed that project proponents should retain a central role in conducting CEA, but government agencies should lead the collection/provision of information about other projects in the study area and baseline VC conditions. Information and knowledge management resources could be also applied in the context of governmental agencies and consultancy firms to support CEA for biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Many studies have tried to explain spatial and temporal variations in biodiversity status of marine areas from a single-issue perspective, such as fishing pressure or coastal pollution, yet most continental seas experience a wide range of human pressures. Cumulative impact assessments have been developed to capture the consequences of multiple stressors for biodiversity, but the ability of these assessments to accurately predict biodiversity status has never been tested or ground-truthed. This relationship has similarly been assumed for the Baltic Sea, especially in areas with impaired status, but has also never been documented. Here we provide a first tentative indication that cumulative human impacts relate to ecosystem condition, i.e. biodiversity status, in the Baltic Sea. Thus, cumulative impact assessments offer a promising tool for informed marine spatial planning, designation of marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management, and may prove useful for setting limits on allowable levels of human impact on ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment differs from conventional project-specific impact assessment by considering larger geographic study areas, longer time frames, and unrelated projects or activities. Cumulative assessments of right-of-way proposals pose particular challenges for several reasons: (1) no prescribed or standard methods currently exist; (2) there are inherent, but frequently unrecognized, differences between project-specific cumulative effects assessments and those done for resource management or planning purposes; and (3) conventional approaches are more applicable to developments that are isolated in space rather than in long, linear corridors. The “representative areas” approach described here has been successfully used in recent federally and provincially regulated pipeline proposals in western Canada. With this approach, assessment of cumulative environmental effects is conducted for representative areas comprised of one or more 1:50,000 scale map sheets. These areas are selected to include multiple project facilities or activities and to reflect biophysical conditions and administrative boundaries. Impact analyses conducted for these representative areas consider indices of landscape conditions and compare these to established or derived thresholds for indicator species or groups. The relative merits and disadvantages of this approach are discussed from the perspective of proponents, regulators, environmental organizations, and practitioners. The use of representative areas and landscape indices is concluded to be a proven alternative for linear projects of all sizes.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews trends in the academic literature on cumulative effects assessment (CEA) of disturbance on forest ecosystems to advance research in the broader context of impact assessments. Disturbance is any distinct spatiotemporal event that disrupts the structure and composition of an ecosystem affecting resource availability. We developed a Python package to automate search term selection, write search strategies, reduce bias and improve the efficient and effective selection of articles from academic databases and grey literature. We identified 148 peer-reviewed literature published between 1986 and 2022 and conducted an inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the results. Our findings revealed that CEA studies are concentrated in the global north, with most publications from authors affiliated with government agencies in the USA and Canada. Methodological and analytical approaches are less interdisciplinary but mainly quantitative and expert-driven, involving modeling the impacts of disturbances on biophysical valued components. Furthermore, the assessment of socioeconomic valued components, including the effects of disturbance on Indigenous wellbeing connected to forests, has received less attention. Even though there is a high preference for regional assessment, challenges with data access, quality, and analysis, especially baseline data over long periods, are hampering effective CEA. Few articles examined CEA - policy/management nexus. Of the few studies, challenges such as the inadequate implementation of CEA mitigation strategies due to policy drawbacks and resource constraints, the high cost of monitoring multiple indicators, and poor connections between scenarios/modeling and management actions were paramount. Future CEA research is needed to broaden our understanding of how multiple disturbance affects forests in the global south and coupled social and ecological systems and their implications for sustainable forest management.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Regional environmental risk assessment is a practical approach to understanding and proactively addressing the cumulative effects of resource development in areas of regional importance. However, regional assessment is methodologically complex, and frameworks to identify and prioritize regional risk issues to guide effective management decisions are lacking. This research develops a risk and impacts-based cumulative effects assessment framework for scoping regional cumulative effects issues to guide present and future project and regional assessment. We operationalized the framework dubbed Risk Assessment Framework for Cumulative Effects (RAFCE) to assess the risks and impacts of proposed mining development in the Ring of Fire region of Northern Ontario, Canada.Methods: Methodologically, we built on existing studies to understand the key valued ecosystem components (VECs) impacted by mining; organized an expert Bowtie Risk Assessment Tool workshop and interviews to identify regional risks and define the VECs impacted by mining; and developed an impact prioritization model that helped quantify and prioritize impacts of mining.Results and Discussion: RAFCE enabled us to: a) identify drivers and impacts of cumulative effects and potential preventive and mitigation measures for effective cumulative effects management and b) describe, quantify, and rank the major impact and components of regional interest. Using RAFCE, we can identify and prioritize impacts that are cross-cutting, multisector‐driven, synergistic, and relevant to a region, visualize and understand the risk management process, identify policy and management issues to prevent risks or mitigate impacts, and ultimately inform resource allocation for effective regional cumulative effects assessment outcomes. RAFCE is suitable for engaging diverse stakeholders in planning for regional cumulative effects assessment.},

  abstract = {Cumulatively, the effects of resource extraction and climate change have the potential to cause an unprecedented change to the ecosystems and livelihoods of Indigenous communities in Canada's northern regions. Maintaining environmental and community values in the presence of such change will require a comprehensive understanding of potential long-term risks and opportunities to prevent or mitigate risks at the regional level. However, assessing the cumulative impact and benefits of the multiple disturbances at the regional level is complex due to the interaction of numerous drivers, values, actors, assessment scales, planning, and decision-making processes. We develop an integrated risk and cumulative effects (CE) management methodology to inform regional assessment by combining conceptual modelling through bowtie analysis and quantitative scenario analysis using ALCES Online (AO) simulation. We applied the framework using a case example in the Ring of Fire region of northern Ontario, Canada, to assess the CE of climate change, land use change, and wildlife harvest on the moose (Alces alces)-wolf (Canis lupus)-caribou (Rangifer tarandus) prey-predator system. The bowtie risk analysis provided a mechanism to define the management problem by identifying threats that contribute to risk, associated consequences, and specific management strategies that could be pursued under legislative frameworks and changes to maintain the sustainable dynamics of the moose-wolf-caribou system (MWC). The AO simulation of different levels of development and moose harvest, as well a baseline scenario that excluded climate change and development, allowed for a comprehensive examination of the complex processes driving the social-ecological system. The scenario analysis suggests that moose harvest can promote balance in the MWC system but only if applied in a sophisticated manner that limits moose harvest in areas with high road density, increases moose harvest in more remote regions susceptible to moose population expansion with climate change, and prioritizes Indigenous moose harvest to ensure a sustainable supply of moose for subsistence harvest. The case example shows how conceptual and quantitative modelling can provide the strategic perspective required for regional assessment.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide the foundations for the development of a spatial decision-support toolset that combines cumulative impacts and ecosystem service supply assessments to support what-if scenario analysis in a maritime spatial planning context. Specifically, a conceptual framework for a toolset has been designed in order to introduce a new approach for place-based assessments of change in relative ecosystem service supply in multiple services at a time due to changes in cumulative impacts. Central to the toolset are two pre-existing approaches for relative ecosystem service supply and cumulative impact assessments and tools that facilitate them. The tools take advantage of available data from various sources, including geodata and expert knowledge, and have already been proven to support maritime spatial planning in a real-world context. To test the new approach and demonstrate the outputs, an ecosystem service supply assessment was done manually using the two currently separate tools. The results of the test case ecosystem service supply assessment for the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea are also presented in this paper and illustrate the assessment steps and data needs. Although presently the focus of the illustrative assessment is the Gulf of Riga, the toolset will be able to accommodate analysis of cumulative impacts and service supply of any location, leaving the scope of the assessment to be determined by the objectives of the assessment as well as data availability (i.e., geospatial data availability and extent of expert knowledge).},

A major challenge is that there has been limited attention devoted to understanding decision-making at the project level, and the value of monitoring data to support cumulative effects analysis. This article examines how cumulative effects are considered during environmental assessment decision-making within the context of freshwater management in the Mackenzie Valley, Northwest Territories. Interviews with representatives from organizations involved in environmental assessment, regulation, and monitoring are used to identify challenges to applying information about cumulative effects at the project scale. Results reinforce the need for regional approaches and improvements in information and monitoring capacities to support cumulative effects analysis, but also the need to address institutional and organizational deficiencies to ensure that the data and information generated are useful to and applied within project-based decision-making.},

Understanding cumulative social effects is important for decisions about prospective resource development projects, but there has been limited attention devoted to how to complete such an assessment. This paper critically examines how cumulative effects frameworks are applied to social impacts during environmental assessments. We do this by analyzing semi-structured interviews exploring practitioner experience in environmental assessments for hydroelectric development in British Columbia and Manitoba, Canada. The results provide a conceptual framework for cumulative social effects and illustrate how identified challenges for cumulative effects assessment are exacerbated by social impacts that introduce additional complexities in impact identification, assessment, and decision-making.

  abstract = {Systems that allow users to store and retrieve spatial data, provide for analyses of spatial data, and offer highly detailed display of spatial data are referred to as geographic information systems, or more typically, GIS. Since their initial usage in the 1960s, GISs have evolved as a means of assembling and analyzing diverse data pertaining to specific geographical areas, with spatial locations of the data serving as the organizational basis for the information systems. The structure of GISs is built around spatial identifiers and the methods used to encode data for storage and manipulation. This paper examines how GIS has been used in typical environmental assessment, its use for cumulative impact assessment, and explores litigation that occurred in the United States Federal court system where GIS was used in some aspect of cumulative effects.

  abstract = {If mining proposals are to receive more positive reception in host communities and regions, they will need to be planned, reviewed and approved in ways that ensure they contribute to more sustainable regional futures. That transition will require improvements in individual project assessment practice-especially a shift from a focus on mitigating “significant adverse effects” to requiring “positive contributions to sustainability” as well as avoidance of adverse effects. It will also demand more effective regional planning and other strategic level efforts to provide attention to the cumulative regional effects of multiple mining projects, associated infrastructure and other past, current and anticipated activities. Such broader work would provide a better examined context and more authoritative guidance for individual project planning and development. Regional scale planning and assessment are largely a responsibility of governments, not something that individual mine proponents can reasonably be expected to deliver adequately in project-based assessment and approval processes. This paper reviews the current status of assessment regimes, identifies deficiencies and suggests where best practice opportunities exist. The implications are summarized as recommendations for assessment regime design that addresses cumulative effects, largely through regional processes linked to project-level assessments, and that incorporate the following five characteristics: (i) Multi-dimensional: covers the full suite of cumulative effects of multiple undertakings, past, present and reasonably foreseeable in the relevant regional future (well beyond the individual project level), in light of contribution to sustainability objectives; (ii) Long term: uses scenarios or some equivalent to explore and illuminate the nature and potential implications of plausible and desirable futures, to identify alternative pathways and plan options to examine; (iii) Credible: establishes explicit open processes for elaborating and evaluating regional alternatives and justifying decisions in light of context-specified sustainability-based criteria and trade-off rules; (iv) Authoritative: integrates regional assessment conclusions as decisions in legislatively authoritative regional plans or the equivalent with provisions for ensuring compliance in project level planning and assessment; and (v) Accountable: ensures clear and accountable assignment of cumulative effects management responsibilities and expectations, including provisions for engaged monitoring, effective responses and public reporting. Special attention to legacy effects is also emphasized because orebodies are non-renewable resources. For illustrative purposes, the paper considers approaches to anticipated mining development in the Ring of Fire region, 500 km of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, where reliance on individual project assessments is problematic given the regional cumulative effects issues and the range of alternative response options.

  abstract = {Social impact assessment (SIA) has traditionally been practiced as an ex-ante predictive tool in the context of regulatory approval by government agencies. This model of SIA developed by Burdge and others is based on `greenfields' development, of a new project going in to areas where there are no, or relatively few, similar types of development. The International Principles of SIA signalled a conceptual shift in the practice of SIA where greater emphasis is placed on the assessment and management of social issues across the life-cycle of developments. In addition forms of cumulative impact assessment have been developed for contexts where more than one project is likely to impact on populations or communities. With these changes to the traditional models of impact assessment there is a need to clarify how and when dedicated phases of `assessment' might be undertaken over the life-cycle of a development. In the context of the mining industry, SIAs are increasingly required by governments for incremental increases in the size or impact of these operations. This paper reviews the development and application of Project Expansion Assessments (PEAs) for two large-scale mining operations in Papua New Guinea. It argues that a different set of assumptions need to underlie the model of IA for such assessments, with more emphasis on trajectories rather than baselines, a critical evaluation and attribution of effects, and the incorporation of adaptive management tools into the process.

  abstract = {1. The Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis is very susceptible to the negative effects of wind farms. In northern Portugal, this evidence is particularly severe due to the skylark's preference for mountain breeding habitats where most wind farms are located. Facing the frequent failure of environmental impact assessments (ETA) to evaluate the cumulative impacts of wind farms on wildlife, this study aimed to develop and test a methodology to quantify local and regional consequences on birds, using skylarks as a test species, taking into account future predictable environmental changes. 2. We propose a spatially explicit dynamic approach that combines the results from multiple modelling techniques under a common framework to assess the local and cumulative regional impacts of wind farms on skylark populations. This includes the following: (i) modelling the local impact of wind farms (in terms of collision mortality) on the skylark population dynamics by developing an index for quantitative assessments, (ii) determining the actual and future skylark breeding distribution across northern Portugal and (iii) integrating the above contributions in an emergent spatially explicit regional representation to capture the ecological cumulative consequences as a whole. 3. The simulations show an increasing average local impact for the skylark breeding populations directly affected by wind farms, expressed in mean number of collision fatalities per UTM study unit (1 km(2)), representing 1.3\% of the local breeders in 2006 and 4\% in 2026. 4. The distribution area of skylark breeding populations as predicted to decrease around 4.5\% throughout a period of 15 years, as a result of the scenario of climate and land cover changes in the study area. When combined with a concomitant increase in skylark global mortality (c. 184\%) induced by all wind farms in the study region, the above trend contributes to an intensification of the regional cumulative impact from 1.2\% to 3.7\% of the total estimated breeding individuals. 5. Synthesis and applications. The proposed modelling framework represents a step forward in evaluating the multi-scale cumulative consequences of wind farms on vulnerable birds, using skylarks as a test species. This could be used in the future to guide monitoring efforts and to improve the applicability of the data bases generated by long-term ecological research and monitoring studies.},

  abstract = {As recently reinforced in the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), knowledge on the location and intensity of human impacts on marine ecosystems is critical for effective marine management and conservation. Human interaction with ecosystems has to be accounted for in order to efficiently implement marine management strategies. In the present study, the main human activities occurring along the mainland Portuguese coast were identified and mapped. The cumulative impact of these activities was calculated in order to assess impacts in different zones, namely in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and their boundaries. Higher impact values were obtained near the coast, where all the analysed MPAs are located. Furthermore, most MPAs are sorrounded by areas with very high impacts, near the largest urban settlements and the most industrialized coastal sections. These results are the first assessment of cumulative human pressures in this study area as a whole (and with this level of resolution) and might be of great usefulness to overcome the current challenges of sustainable management in marine ecosystems. Knowledge provided by this study strengthens the need for a more integrative approach to design and manage MPAs and can be useful to support the requirements of the MSFD. The approach here developed is also a powerful tool to apply in several contexts of sustainable marine management and can be developed in any geographic area.},

  abstract = {The St. Lawrence is a vast and complex socio-ecological system providing a wealth of services sustaining numerous economic sectors. These ecosystems are subject to significant human pressures that overlap and potentially interact with climate driven environmental changes. Our objective in this paper is to systematically characterize the distribution and intensity of drivers in the St. Lawrence System. To do so, we launch eDrivers, an open knowledge platform gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. We gathered data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. We show that few areas of the St. Lawrence are free of cumulative exposure. The Estuary, the Anticosti Gyre and coastal areas are particularly exposed, especially in the vicinity of urban centers. We identified 6 areas of distinct cumulative exposure regime that show that certain drivers typically co-occur in different regions of the St. Lawrence and that coastal areas are exposed to all driver types. Of particular concern are two threat complexes capturing most exposure hotspots that show the convergence of contrasting exposure regimes at the head of the Laurentian Channel. eDrivers was built on a series of guiding principles upholding existing data management and open science standards. We therefore expect it to evolve through time to address knowledge gaps and refine current driver layers. Ultimately, we believe that eDrivers represents a much needed solution that could radically influence broad scale research and management practices by increasing knowledge accessibility and interoperability.},

  abstract = {The cumulative effects of human actions on wetland ecosystems motivate current efforts at wetland restoration. They also have created in part the context within which restorations are undertaken. Using modern hydrogeological understanding of wetland-landscape linkages, I argue that restorations should begin with a cumulative impact analysis for the entire region in which the restoration is proposed. The analysis, however, should not focus merely on number of hectares of wetlands lost or degraded. It should be based on the concept of templates for wetland development. These templates are the diversity of settings created in specific landscapes by the complex interactions of hydrogeologic factors and climate. They control key hydrologic variables and hydrologically influenced chemical variables that cause specific wetland types to form and to be maintained through time. They also determine in large part the biogeochemical cycling characteristics specific to different types of wetlands. They thus account for both the biological and functional diversity of wetlands. A cumulative impact assessment for restoration purposes should identify the kinds, numbers, relative abundances, and spatial distribution of wetland templates in a region-both past and present. These past and present profiles of the wetland landscape can be used to make decisions regarding the type and location of restorations. Matching type and location to the appropriate hydrogeologic setting will maximize the probability of success for individual projects. Regional wetland diversity can be restored if individual restoration decisions about wetland type and location are made in light of the diversity of templates in past and present regional profiles.},

  abstract = {Predicting cumulative effects is an important challenge of theoretical and management ecology. If a population will be exposed to multiple stressors (e.g., toxins, introduced competitors, climate change), will their cumulative effects be independent and hence multiplicative (the population survival rates due to each stressor can be multiplied together to determine the total reduction in abundance), synergistic (cumulative effects are greater than multiplicative), or antagonistic (stressors offset each other so cumulative effects are less than multiplicative)? Further, the effects of each stressor can vary with such factors as habitat quality, population density, and weather. It is difficult to predict cumulative effects with traditional population-level models because such models must assume the type and strength of stressor interactions a priori, and measuring stressor effects and interactions empirically is rarely practical. Instead, we used an individual-based model in which cumulative effects emerge from how each stressor affects the growth and survival of individuals, and how individuals interact. Our model is in fact based on theoretical concepts explored in the landmark 1980 paper of DeAngelis et al. (Cannibalism and size dispersal in young-of-the-year largemouth bass: experiment and model, Ecol. Model. 8, 133-148): in a community of fish that eat each other, initial differences in size among individuals have strong effects on subsequent abundance and size distributions. We model survival and growth of juvenile Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius) during their first year, and two stressors they are subject to. The first stressor is a daily cycle of flow fluctuations imposed by an upstream hydroelectric dam; these fluctuations affect habitat area, food supply, and temperature, which then affect juvenile fish growth. Second is an introduced fish species that competes with pikeminnow for food, while both species can prey on each other via the size-based mechanism described by DeAngelis et al. We simulated the effects of the 36 combinations of six levels of these two stressors in each of 28 sites and weather year to produce 840 scenarios, using 7 weather year datasets as replicates. Emergent cumulative effects were multiplicative in 69\% of these scenarios, synergistic in 22\%, and antagonistic in 9\%. Therefore, any a priori assumption about stressor interactions would be wrong in many situations. Synergistic effects were most common in deeper and larger habitats favorable to the introduced species; antagonistic effects were most common in smaller habitats where the introduced species had low growth, because flow fluctuations further reduced the small food supply.

  abstract = {With expanding human uses at sea, the objective of maritime spatial planning (MSP) to promote sustainable coexistence between marine uses becomes an increasingly challenging task. In order to assess coexistence options, both use-use interactions and use-environment interactions are important to explore. Tools for doing cumulative impact assessments (CIA) on the environment provide a means for spatially exploring environmental impacts. Finding inspiration in such ecosystem-based spatial use-environment approaches while drawing on pairwise marine use compatibility knowledge from existing literature, a spatial approach to model potential synergies and conflicts between marine uses through an expert-based scoring system is presented and implemented in SEANERGY, an ArcMap-based opensource toolbox. A test based on Baltic Sea GIS-data demonstrates how SEANERGY supplements CIA analyses with knowledge about potential use-use synergies, potential use-use conflicts, and their spatial extents, useful for optimising the use of marine space in MSP without putting too much cumulative pressure on the environment.},

  abstract = {The southern Benguela ecosystem faces complex pressures from anthropogenic activities and climate change, leading to structural and functional changes. To counter ecosystem service losses, intergovernmental marine science organizations propose integrated management. However, predictions to evaluate alternative strategies are challenging due to multifaceted sector interactions affecting ecological components. Scoping phases of Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEA), such as the Options for Delivering Ecosystem-Based Marine Management (ODEMM), identify priority sectors and pressures for management using linkage chains and impact risk scores. This study expands a South African-wide ODEMM assessment to investigate dependent sectors in the southern Benguela. Fishing emerged as the primary sector, exhibiting high connectance and impact risk on ecological components. Disaggregation of the fishing sector into sub-sectors and over three 21-year time periods revealed the demersal trawl and mixed species inshore trawl sectors to still have the greatest impact despite recent mitigation efforts, driven by species extraction, bycatch, and `incidental loss'. Research gaps, such as the effects of recreational fisheries and underwater noise, were identified and need to be addressed to improve future ecosystem assessments. Additionally, the effects of climate on long-term, ecosystem-scale variability and change need more attention in IEAs and should be incorporated into frameworks such as ODEMM.},

In an attempt to generate hypotheses, we compared their attempts to maintain legitimacy, in its various aspects, for both their industries and the regulatory regimes that evolved as the controversies persisted. Both the existing literature and the two cases suggest that greater use of multi-sectoral stakeholder forums for the governance of cumulative impacts can bolster the legitimacy of both the industry and its regulatory regime, including those aspects handled through self-regulation. The cases suggested the additional hypotheses that (a) the importance of the decisions allocated to the multi-stakeholder regulatory forum affects legitimacy perceptions generally, and (b) the multi-stakeholder approach to regulation does little to bolster legitimacy when stakeholders include activists who are more interested in transnational issues than local cumulative impacts.

  abstract = {Cumulative impacts assessments on marine ecosystems have been hindered by the difficulty of collecting environmental data and identifying drivers of community dynamics beyond local scales. On coral reefs, an additional challenge is to disentangle the relative influence of multiple drivers that operate at different stages of coral ontogeny. We integrated coral life history, population dynamics, and spatially explicit environmental drivers to assess the relative and cumulative impacts of multiple stressors across 2,300 km of the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Using literature data, we characterized relationships between coral life history processes (reproduction, larval dispersal, recruitment, growth, and mortality) and environmental variables. We then simulated coral demographics and stressor impacts at the organism (coral colony) level on ¿3,800 individual reefs linked by larval connectivity and exposed to temporally and spatially realistic regimes of acute (crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, cyclones, and mass coral bleaching) and chronic (water-quality) stressors. Model simulations produced a credible reconstruction of recent (2008-2020) coral trajectories consistent with monitoring observations, while estimating the impacts of each stressor at reef and regional scales. Overall, simulated coral populations declined by one-third across the GBR, from an average of similar to 29\% to similar to 19\% hard coral cover. By 2020, ¡20\% of the GBR had coral cover higher than 30\%, a status of reef health corroborated by scarce and sparsely distributed monitoring data. Reef-wide annual rates of coral mortality were driven by bleaching (48\%) ahead of cyclones (41\%) and starfish predation (11\%). Beyond the reconstructed status and trends, the model enabled the emergence of complex interactions that compound the effects of multiple stressors while promoting a mechanistic understanding of coral cover dynamics. Drivers of coral cover growth were identified; notably, water quality (suspended sediments) was estimated to delay recovery for at least 25\% of inshore reefs. Standardized rates of coral loss and recovery allowed the integration of all cumulative impacts to determine the equilibrium cover for each reef. This metric, combined with maps of impacts, recovery potential, water-quality thresholds, and reef state metrics, facilitates strategic spatial planning and resilience-based management across the GBR.},

  abstract = {Bird collision assessments are generally made at the scale of a single wind farm. While especially in offshore situations such assessments already hold several assumptions, even bigger challenges exist on estimating the cumulative impact of multiple wind farms and the impacts at population level. In this paper, the number of collision victims at Belgian offshore wind farms was estimated with a (theoretical) collision risk model based on technical turbine specifications, bird-related parameters and bird density data of both local seabirds and passerine migrants. Bird density data were gathered by visual censuses and radar registrations. The outcome of the model was extrapolated to future development scenarios in the Belgian part of the North Sea and in the entire North Sea, and then further used for a preliminary assessment of the impact at population level for the species at risk. The results indicate that the cumulative impact of a realistic scenario of 10,000 turbines in the North Sea might have a significant negative effect at population level for lesser and great black-backed gull. We further show that during a single night of intense songbird migration, the number of collision victims among passerine migrants might be in the order of magnitude of several thousands in the entire North Sea. We argue that it is of great importance to further develop methods to quantify the uncertainties and to minimise the assumptions, in order to assure more reliable cumulative impact assessments.},

  abstract = {This study developed the “ECUME” risk-based approach to identify and prioritize critical impact pathways to be considered in cumulative impact assessment of offshore windfarms, and for future research. The prioritization framework has been tested on two offshore windfarms projects located in the French part of the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, those of Fe ` camp and Courseulles-sur-Mer. The approach is based on a complete inventory of impact pathways, prioritizing those for which an impact assessment will be carried out. The aim was to avoid a “quantification bias” and elaborate a systemic vision. The novelty of the study is to apply a combination of expert judgement, consensus building, and a scoring system, to prioritize the pairs of pressures and receptors of the marine environment to work on. The scoring system is based on the ecological importance of receptors, the degree of knowledge on the effect of a pressure on a receptor and the sensitivity of each receptor to pressures. Priorities for research were also determined during the same process. Bringing together a large set of specialized marine environnement scientists, the initial challenge was to build a common vocabulary, and a shared understanding of the risk-based prioritization approach. This required significant time and effort but secured foundations for further work. This study confirms the increasingly shared view that adopting a risk-based approach considering adverse effects on receptors is an efficient way to assess cumulative impacts, to focus on critical impact pathways, and manage the scientific complexity and the significant uncertainties.},

  abstract = {It is commonly understood that the cumulative impact of increased habitat destruction on biological systems does not scale linearly. Despite this, current environmental decision-making strategies often fail to incorporate these non-linearities because impact assessments are regularly performed independently without considering contributions to future cumulative impacts, which are, instead, externalised to the environment. Here we used a stochastic modelling framework to examine the effect of three decision-making strategies - externalised, individually-borne and shared cumulative costs - on the number of species driven to extinction by the development of a region. We also tested how different levels of vulnerability (quantified as the correlation between development benefits and species richness) and irreplaceability (expressed as the average area of occupancy of an assemblage) influence the outcomes of development. Overall, the inclusion of cumulative impacts in our simulations resulted in the destruction of fewer patches and, as a consequence, more modest benefits obtained from developments. Moreover, these patterns were strongest when cumulative costs were shared by all developers. The most striking finding was that the distinction between decision-making strategies was highest in landscapes of high vulnerability and irreplaceability. Environmental decision-makers are recommended to commit to a strategy for incorporating the cumulative costs of development because, as this study suggests, this affects the endpoints of conservation and development considerably; especially in the most vulnerable and irreplaceable landscapes.

  abstract = {Both environmental indicators and multi-metric indices are useful for describing baseline conditions and qualitatively predicting the cumulative consequences of multiple actions. Several examples and case studies associated with indicators and/or indices are presented herein. They can be easily modified for usage in CEAM. Habitat suitability models reflect special indices related to habitat needs and quality for specific species or broad habitat types. Such models have been used to address direct and indirect effects, and with some modification, they can be also used to address cumulative effects of multiple actions. This review has indicated that there are numerous examples of such tools which have been or could be used in both EIA and CEAM. Some key lessons are: (1) in conducting CEAM studies, it is useful to think from the mindset that “I am the VEC or indicator, and what is my historical and current condition and how have I, or will I, be affected by multiple past, present, and future actions?”: (2) due to the likely absence of detailed information on future actions, the described tools can still be used to “predict” future conditions by focusing on qualitative up-or-down changes in individual indicators or indices with their aggregated displays: and (3) numerous regional and site-specific tools are currently available, with one example being indices of biological integrity for specific watersheds and water bodies. Such tools, even though they may not have been developed for CEAM usage, can certainly benefit CEAM studies and practice. Finally, usage of selected and appropriate tools as described herein can aid in conducting science-based, systematic, and documentable CEAM studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Amazon River basins concentrate a large part of the hydroelectric plants planned to meet the national electricity demands. The debate about the significant socio-environmental impacts associated with the advancement of hydroelectric frontiers in the Amazon region has been intense. Due to the socio-environmental vulnerability of the Amazon region to the hydroelectric dams, it is relevant to discuss the associated cumulative impacts. The planning of the hydropower sector uses two impact assessment tools: the Environmental Impact Study (EIS), for analyzing the environmental feasibility of hydroelectric dams, and the Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA), for analyzing impacts from a set of hydroelectric into watershed. The research focuses on “Teles Pires” river basin where a series of hydropower projects has been planned. The objective was to analyze the assessment of cumulative impacts from the watershed to the hydroelectric through the impact assessment instruments. A research instrument has been used to synthesize guidelines for the evaluation of cumulative impacts in watershed and criteria was used to associate impacts in the watershed and in the individual hydropower projects. The main results reveal that: a) some of the good international practices for assessing cumulative impacts in watersheds are present in the environmental planning of hydroelectric dams; b) the analysis of cumulative impacts in the basin considers only the effects of hydroelectric projects; c) the cumulative impacts identified at the river basin level - in the IEA - were partially observed in the hydroelectric dams - in the EISs. The sector has the merit of integrating cumulative impacts assessment principles in taking decision in watersheds. However to guarantee the effectiveness of the instrument it is recommended to extend the scope of this analysis to other actions besides the hydroelectric ones. More value can be achieved by adopting procedures to carry out the EIS embedded in good practices for considering cumulative impacts at the level of hydroelectric projects.},

Drawing on key informant interviews with policy actors from government, non-government and private sector organizations working on Impact Assessment in Eeyou Istchee, the potential for more decentralized and networked approaches to regional wildlife monitoring and baseline data collection in support of CEA is considered. Results suggest a shared willingness to collaborate towards improving the overall regional environmental conditions and to generate long-term data on wildlife population and distribution. Challenges include the absence of essential supporting programs (land-use plans, regional environmental frameworks, lead monitoring agencies, designated funding), and high levels of distrust between proponents and NGOs which combine to suppress the initiation of collaborative governance processes as well as the potential utility of any regional monitoring program that might be established. The need for leadership to facilitate reciprocal knowledge flows among actors, build trust and enable long-term cooperative structures based on a shared vision and goal congruency is identified.},

Information was gathered on existing policy and planning instruments, and relationships among the authorities and other partners that enable water resource management. Key facilitating factors for W-CEAM in the GRW include established institutions, a mature conservation authority and an ecological focus to resource management strategies, while constraining factors include obfuscation of leadership roles and lack of multi-scalar approaches to watershed science. We conclude that it is useful to conceptualize W-CEAM as characterized by both a managerial and a scientific ethos - the former facilitating the latter - and that institutional goodwill, political will and institutional capacity for innovation and creativity are additional institutional core requisites to W-CEAM.},

  abstract = {Assessing and managing cumulative effects on watersheds involves numerous agencies, regulatory frameworks and jurisdictions, and necessitates the co-creation of new, or innovations in existing, institutional arrangements. This paper examines the institutional arrangements needed to implement and sustain cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM) for watersheds. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 29 key informants in the Grand River watershed, Canada, including members from academia, government agencies, consulting firms, non-governmental organizations, and First Nations, with knowledge of, and direct experience in, watershed planning, assessment and monitoring. The research explored governance conditions in the watershed based on a framework of CEAM requisites developed from other watersheds where institutional arrangements have been investigated. Results indicate the need for improved institutional arrangements in the Grand River watershed to support the development of watershed CEAM, namely: a combined law-policy approach to implement CEAM, yet ensuring sensitivity to watershed context; a strong mandate for CEAM leadership and the capacity to coordinate CEAM initiatives; and tiering of CEAM planning, monitoring and assessment initiatives as a means to strengthen nested governance structures.},

We describe a process where the interview findings with 28 key aboriginal and non-aboriginal informants in the Champagne Aishihik First Nations' (CAFN) Traditional Territory were summarized into key themes by researchers in a community workshop to elicit a selection of social indicators for future cumulative effects assessments. These responses were visions for the future based on a great deal of experiential learning that interviewees identified part and parcel of any betterment to the community as new developments unfold. Themes such as “social healing” were further broken into indicators such as “community support systems” and then further broken into local measures, such as “the presence of, and access to, a youth centre, youth programs, and youth centres”. The local historical approach to cumulative effects assessment helps us not only understand more about forestry, but more about the broader connections between community members and leaders, forestry and other resource developments, and lessons people have learned from the past and visions for the future.},

As we progress towards EBM, risk assessments must move beyond an evaluation of the direct impacts of a single stressor on a species or habitat. Here, we propose 12 risk assessment criteria that explicitly reflect the principles of EBM. These criteria include the need to assess risk to multiple ecosystem components and values, evaluate place and time-specific ecological complexity, evaluate recovery, accommodate different knowledge types and communicate uncertainty. Contemporary risk assessment approaches rarely meet all 12 criteria and whilst many approaches could be adapted to do so, some are more easily modified than others. Risk assessment approaches that meet our criteria have the greatest potential to support decision-making in an EBM context and thereby safeguard our marine environments and their values for future generations.},

In order to protect the marine environment and manage the activities, various national legislative approaches have been implemented to address the requirements of the international London Protocol/ London Convention (LPLC). The LPLC aims to prevent and reduce pollution of the sea associated with dumping of wastes and other matter. Although not a prerequisite of the London Protocol, regional and national regulatory frameworks require that assessments for disposing waste at sea include a cumulative effects context considering the effects from other marine activities occurring in a given area. Here we review a selection of cumulative effect assessment approaches and principles that could be applied to enhance the assessment requirements of the LPLC. We recommend that those countries that are parties to the LCLP consider which CEA approach is of most applicable to their own country and activities, perhaps a combination, and ensure robust assessments are carried out to ensure the marine environment is as sustainably managed as possible.},

  abstract = {Environmental impact assessment, as it has been practised generally, is limited in several ways. Two characteristics are cause for particular concern. The first is that it is a reactive process, rather than representing a proactive approach to environmental management. The second is that the project-based approach often means that the combined effects of two or more developments are often overlooked. Concepts developed under the heading of cumulative environmental change present some clues to the appropriate reform of impact assessment, particularly with respect to these two failings. An analysis of the concept is presented here and we discuss also some general issues that arise in respect to the assessment of cumulative change. The latter include boundary issues, ecological response characteristics, monitoring, socio-economic effects and issues in evaluation. A consideration of the institutional context for the management of cumulative change leads us to propose a regional approach, as opposed to project-based assessments. Links between cumulative effects assessment, state-of-the-environment reporting and planning for sustainability are explored.},

Existing evaluation methods are reviewed here as to their suitability for cumulative effects assessment.

The experience suggests that these methods have a contribution to make to cumulative effects assessment.},

  abstract = {Considerable effort is being deployed to predict the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the ocean's biophysical environment, biodiversity, and natural resources to better understand how marine ecosystems and provided services to humans are likely to change and explore alternative pathways and options. We present an updated version of EcoOcean (v2), a spatial-temporal ecosystem modeling complex of the global ocean that spans food-web dynamics from primary producers to top predators. Advancements include an enhanced ability to reproduce spatial-temporal ecosystem dynamics by linking species productivity, distributions, and trophic interactions to the impacts of climate change and worldwide fisheries. The updated modeling platform is used to simulate past and future scenarios of change, where we quantify the impacts of alternative configurations of the ecological model, responses to climate-change scenarios, and the additional impacts of fishing. Climate-change scenarios are obtained from two Earth-System Models (ESMs, GFDL-ESM2M, and IPSL-CMA5-LR) and two contrasting emission pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5) for historical (1950-2005) and future (2006-2100) periods. Standardized ecological indicators and biomasses of selected species groups are used to compare simulations. Results show how future ecological trajectories are sensitive to alternative configurations of EcoOcean, and yield moderate differences when looking at ecological indicators and larger differences for biomasses of species groups. Ecological trajectories are also sensitive to environmental drivers from alternative ESM outputs and RCPs, and show spatial variability and more severe changes when IPSL and RCP 8.5 are used. Under a non-fishing configuration, larger organisms show decreasing trends, while smaller organisms show mixed or increasing results. Fishing intensifies the negative effects predicted by climate change, again stronger under IPSL and RCP 8.5, which results in stronger biomass declines for species already losing under climate change, or dampened positive impacts for those increasing. Several species groups that win under climate change become losers under combined impacts, while only a few (small benthopelagic fish and cephalopods) species are projected to show positive biomass changes under cumulative impacts. EcoOcean v2 can contribute to the quantification of cumulative impact assessments of multiple stressors and of plausible ocean-based solutions to prevent, mitigate and adapt to global change.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of this new assessment approach, hypotheses describing relationships between an independent variable, use of the cumulative impact assessment approach, and nine dependent variables were developed. A quasi-experiment, in which the cumulative impact assessment approach was the treatment, was conducted to determine how the approach influenced the permit review process. The evaluation procedure was applied to the test implementation of the cumulative impact assessment approach at the San Francisco District. Measures and scoring procedures were devised and data were collected and analyzed. Conclusions regarding the new approach were drawn along with suggestions for improvements to the evaluation procedure.},

Initially, the paper presents the legislative and regulatory requirements for assessing cumulative effects in plans and programmes in the UK. The two approaches for assessing plans in the UK, Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and SEA are discussed and in most cases, a combined SA and SEA process is undertaken by Regional and Local Planning Authorities. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are explored, as well as their usefulness in decision making. There are problems relating to baseline, establishing trends and predicting cumulative effects at the strategic level. The issues in assessing cumulative effects within this SA/SEA framework are discussed and recommendations for improvements are made. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Renewed interest in oil and natural gas in the Beaufort Sea has led to concerns about environmental effects resulting from the oil and gas activities. While environmental effects monitoring programs are being conducted by industry to meet regulatory requirements, and by government agencies in relation to cumulative impact assessment, nobody feels the importance of understanding the environmental changes resulting from oil and gas activities more than the people that live in coastal communities. With the settlement of land claims in Canada's arctic, a co-management approach to resource allocation and use, research, and monitoring has been established. This new form of governance in the arctic is dependent on a high level of community involvement and consultation. The Tariuq (Ocean) community-based monitoring program was piloted in Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik in 2001 as one of the initiatives under the Beaufort Sea Integrated Management Planning Initiative. It is consistent with the principles outlined in Canada's Oceans Act and Canada's Oceans Strategy. The program engages coastal communities in monitoring the health of the Beaufort Sea through their participation in the selection of indicators, conducting of monitoring activities, review of monitoring results, and finally the dissemination of the findings back to the community. Tariuq concurrently, builds capacity within the communities and presents an opportunity to engage and train youth in scientific sampling methods. Community-based monitoring provides the benefits of incorporating traditional knowledge and scientific methodology into a monitoring program. It can also provide a broader spatial and temporal coverage than industry and government monitoring programs.},

  abstract = {As humans exceed global ecological limits nation state-based environmental governance attracts persistent criticism. Historically, the focus of regulatory design for environmental law has been to provide access to natural resources or the environment but without ecosystem-based standards at any scale or cumulative effects assessment by which state governments evaluate whether they are achieving ecosystem health. Illuminated within these nation state regimes are two examples where legal pluralism has or is mandating environmental regulatory design that more explicitly elevates ecological function as a key outcome. Bhutan's relatively recent state environmental laws are part of its broader development approach of Gross National Happiness (GNH), an expression of state, Buddhist, and other customary laws. This `internal legal pluralism' in state policy is expressed through multiple layers of plans and project review by administrative agencies and a GNH screening tool. By contrast, Canada is reforming its environmental laws to account for cumulative impacts and Indigenous rights. In particular, state governments have committed to aligning their laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and plural legal agreements establish unique collaborative governance bodies. The purpose of this article is to examine how legal pluralism is influencing the evolution of regulatory design for environmental governance in Bhutan and Canada. While the plural legal aspects of their regimes have resulted in the prioritization of ecological health, that focus in both regimes is vulnerable without further regulatory scaffolding to establish ecological limits that engage with multiple legal orders at various temporal and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The cumulative effects of human stressors are threatening marine ecosystems. While spatial management tools such as marine conservation areas can help mitigate cumulative effects, several decision-making challenges remain. A limited availability of information and lack of knowledge, inconsistent management approaches, and ineffective consideration of social-ecological interactions hinders current cumulative effects assessment and management efforts. We examined if and how ocean managers assess cumulative effects and incorporate them into their management practices. A survey of the three Canadian federal departments responsible for marine conservation areas was conducted, and focused on the extent to which social and economic factors are considered. Managers seemed to favor ecological factors over social and economic ones when evaluating cumulative effects, such as when defining the spatial and temporal scales to use in their assessments. Managers also indicated a need for greater access to social and economic data and information to improve their assessment and management decisions. Lastly, the lack of a standardized cumulative effects assessment framework and fragmented management approaches appeared to limit managers??? ability to adequately incorporate social and economic factors into assessments. The survey results indicated that a cumulative effects assessment framework that explicitly includes social and economic factors in addition to an enhanced understanding of the suite of factors that influence social-ecological interactions should be developed. This type of framework is essential to help achieve the long-term management solutions required to conserve the health and integrity of Canada's oceans and beyond.},

  abstract = {To alleviate climate change consequences, the UK government is pioneering offshore renewable energy de-velopments at an ever-increasing pace. The North Sea is a dynamic ecosystem with strong bottom-up/top-down natural and anthropogenic drivers facing rapid climate change impacts. To ensure the compatibility of such large-scale developments with nature conservation obligations, regulatory processes set out that all effects need to be evaluated through cumulative impact assessments (CIA). However, by excluding climate change impacts and bottom-up effects of renewable developments, the CIA lacks spatio-temporal baselines linking oceanic ecosystem indicators to population dynamics, leading to uncertain predictions at population levels. CIA is currently required in Europe under the Strategic Environmental Assessment and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), suggesting that these two policy areas should be more closely aligned. This study presents an overview of the current CIA policy framework, enabling an ecosystem-based approach linking lower ecosystem components to top-predator populations using the UK as a case study. At the UK level, CIA requirements mirror the EU ones under the Marine and Coastal Access Act, the UK Marine Policy Statement, and the UK National Policy Statement. Firstly, we show how CIA and MSFD requirements are integrated into the UK licensing and maritime planning frameworks. Secondly, we provide policy pathways embedding the MSFD as a baseline for CIAs with European and UK regulations. Thirdly, we propose a framework encompassing a shared monitoring effort, an ecosystem modelling approach connected with two existing online databases supported with funds from Contracts for Difference. This integrated approach will enable a holistic and pragmatic ecosystem-based framework for more accurate and rapid methods for producing CIAs for offshore renewable energy developments.},

The sea space incorporates multiple marine ecosystem services (MES) that support human-wellbeing and sustain maritime economies, but is also subjected to intensive anthropogenic activities that can affect its vulnerable ecological components. We present a flexible geospatial methodology to assess MES richness (MESR) and to analyse areas of exposure of MES to human impacts using a MES exposure index (MESEx). Source of anthropogenic threats to MES were firstly derived from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and include marine litter (from ports and shipping), underwater noise (from offshore pile driving and shipping) and hazardous substances (from oil extraction platforms). Results were presented for the three main planning areas in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Coastal Stripe, territorial waters and EEZ. In detail, areas of highest MESR are located in the coastal areas of the Lithuanian Mainland Coast that are particularly rich in ecosystem services such as nursery function from for Baltic Herring and cultural services related to valuable recreational resorts, landscape aesthetic values and natural heritage sites. Modelled pressure exposure on selected MES show that cultural ecosystem services in proximity of Klaipeda Port can be particularly affected by marine litter accumulation phenomena, while transboundary effects of potential oil spills from D6-Platform (Kaliningrad Region) can affect valuable fish provisioning areas and coastal cultural values in the Curonian Spit. Results were discussed for the relevance in MES assessment for marine spatial planning in small sea areas and the methodological outlook of the application of geospatial techniques on cumulative impacts assessment within this region of the Baltic Sea.},

  abstract = {The implementation of marine spatial plans as required by the Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) of the European Union (EU) poses novel demands for the development of decision support tools (DST). One fundamental aspect is the need for tools to guide decisions about the allocation of human activities at sea in ways that are ecosystem-based and lead to sustainable use of resources. The MSP Directive was the main driver behind the development of spatial and non-spatial DSTs for the analysis of marine and coastal areas across European seas. In this research we develop an analytical framework designed by DST software developers and managers for the analysis of six DSTs supporting MSP in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. The framework compares the main conceptual, technical and practical aspects, by which these DSTs contribute to advancing the MSP knowledge base and identified future needs for the development of the tools. Results show that all of the studied DSTs include elements to support ecosystem-based management at different geographical scales (from national to macro-regional), relying on cumulative effects assessment and functionalities to facilitate communication at the science-policy interface. Based on our synthesis we propose a set of recommendations for knowledge exchange in relation to further DST developments, mechanisms for sharing experience among the user-developer community, and actions to increase the effectiveness of the DSTs in MSP processes.},

  abstract = {The mining industry is widely criticized for its corporate community development strategies, which led to accusations of greenwash and low social legitimacy. This problem identified led to the following research question: What model of community relations allows companies to generate shared value, in a broad sense, and create long-term relationships with communities? In order to answer the question posed, this paper explores the innovative experiences of the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs in the Antofagasta region of Chile. Calama Plus is an ongoing public-private program (2012-2025) established to combat declining standards of living in the city. Creo Antofagasta is also an ongoing public-private program (2013-2035), which is designed to confront the challenges of rapid growth in the city. Based on these two case studies, their underlying model (i.e., the collaborative community development model) was systematized for this study. The main innovative aspects of the model are its focus on the long-term, its concentration on territory- oriented projects, and its multi-stakeholder governance structure. The latter characteristic implies a collaboration between several companies and even between competitors. Drawing on a collaborative governance framework, the aim of this paper is to extensively describe the companies' perspective on the following: the innovative aspects of the model, the drivers required for companies to participate, how companies can specifically contribute to these programs, and its critical management issues. New drivers and critical management issues are identified and discussed in this research, which represent a contribution to the collaborative governance framework. Since the Calama Plus and Creo Antofagasta programs' focus is long-term, ending in 2025 and 2035 respectively, their impact has not been evaluated. For this reason, we include a discussion on the cumulative impact assessment perspective needed for these collaborative community development programs, placing particular attention on the controversial relationship between mining and local development. This approach is based on the assessment of cross-sector partnership results, its impact on the balance of social, environmental and economic capitals, and on the creation of broadly shared value in terms of long-term socio-economic capability building. Finally, policy implications and the potential for applying this model to other contexts are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This study adapts and applies the evidence-based approach for causal inference, a medical standard, to the restoration and sustainable management of large-scale aquatic ecosystems. Despite long-term investments in restoring aquatic ecosystems, it has proven difficult to adequately synthesize and evaluate program outcomes, and no standard method has been adopted. Complex linkages between restorative actions and ecosystem responses at a landscape scale make evaluations problematic and most programs focus on monitoring and analysis. Herein, we demonstrate a new transdisciplinary approach integrating techniques from evidence-based medicine, critical thinking, and cumulative effects assessment. Tiered hypotheses about the effects of landscape-scale restorative actions are identified using an ecosystem conceptual model. The systematic literature review, a health sciences standard since the 1960s, becomes just one of seven lines of evidence assessed collectively, using critical thinking strategies, causal criteria, and cumulative effects categories. As a demonstration, we analyzed data from 166 locations on the Columbia River and estuary representing 12 indicators of habitat and fish response to floodplain restoration actions intended to benefit culturally and economically important, threatened and endangered salmon. Synthesis of the lines of evidence demonstrated that hydrologic reconnection promoted macrodetritis export, prey availability, and juvenile fish access and feeding. Upon evaluation, the evidence was sufficient to infer cross-boundary, indirect, compounding, and delayed cumulative effects, and suggestive of nonlinear, landscape-scale, and spatial density effects. Therefore, on the basis of causal inferences regarding food-web functions, we concluded that the restoration program is having a cumulative beneficial effect on juvenile salmon. The lines of evidence developed are transferable to other ecosystems: modeling of cumulative net ecosystem improvement, physical modeling of ecosystem controlling factors, meta-analysis of restoration action effectiveness, analysis of data on target species, research on critical ecological uncertainties, evidence-based review of the literature, and change analysis on the landscape setting. As with medicine, the science of ecological restoration needs scientific approaches to management decisions, particularly because the consequences affect species extinctions and the availability of ecosystem services. This evidence-based approach will enable restoration in complex coastal, riverine, and tidal-fluvial ecosystems like the lower Columbia River to be evaluated when data have accumulated without sufficient synthesis.},

Among other provisions, this act requires consideration of cumulative impacts in environmental assessment activities undertaken by planners in newly created regional authorities and district and city councils. The institutional context in which the act is being implemented offers both opportunities and constraints to cumulative impact assessment. A lack of methods for CIA is a recognized problem. However, methods that have been developed for environmental impact assessments can be modified to incorporate second-, third-, and fourth-order impacts as well as to identify the direction and magnitude of additive and synergistic impacts. Layered matrices and combined networks are examples of such methods. While they do not allow for scientific prediction, they do provide the practitioner with the ability to consider the cumulative impacts of decisions. This is crucial in New Zealand, where statutory requirements are ahead of established methodologies.},

Whole organism characteristics of three white sucker populations determined to be resident (outside of spawning) within small sections of the Saint John River, New Brunswick, were studied in 2001 and 2002. Significant differences in performance characteristics were present among sites. The differences can be interpreted as either improved sucker performance at Florenceville (upstream site), or decreased performance at Woodstock. Without further investigation it is difficult to identify whether the apparent improved performance is a response to nutrient enrichment, or increased mortality associated with the recent prevalence of lesions. Confounding factors are also present. Daily water level fluctuations resulting from an upstream dam discharge may change habitat availability and/or diversity, thereby altering the fish community. Liver sizes in Saint John River white sucker are considerably larger than in fish collected in Ontario, but are not relative to nearby New Brunswick river populations. This has implications for the importance of reference site selection and understanding the natural variability within a species (intra-specific variation) on multiple spatial scales.},

  abstract = {As the density of development increases, there is a growing need to address the cumulative effects of project developments on the environment. In Canada this need has been recognized in legislation whereby new project developments that require an environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act are required to address the cumulative effects of proposed project activities relative to the existing environmental condition. Unfortunately, existing stressor-based and effects-based approaches to environmental assessment do not adequately address cumulative effects as defined under the Act when used in isolation. However, elements from each approach can be conceptually incorporated into a holistic cumulative effects assessment framework. Key framework components include: (1) an effects-based assessment to determine existing accumulated environmental state, (2) a stressor-based assessment to predict potential impacts of new development relative to the existing environmental state, (3) post-development monitoring to assess the accuracy of impact predictions and to provide an avenue for adaptive management, and (4) decision-making frameworks to link scientific information to public opinion and managerial action. The key advantage of this framework is that it provides a more holistic, systematic approach for incorporation of ecological information into a scientific and management framework for cumulative effects assessment.},

The objective of this paper is to describe an approach for aquatic cumulative effects assessment that was developed under the Northern Rivers Ecosystem Initiative. The approach is based on a review of existing monitoring practices in Canada and the presence of existing thresholds for aquatic ecosystem health assessments. It suggests that a sustainable framework is possible for cumulative effects assessment of Canadian waters that would result in integration of national indicators of aquatic health, integration of national initiatives (e.g., water quality index, environmental effects monitoring), and provide an avenue where long-term monitoring programs could be integrated with baseline and follow-up monitoring conducted under the environmental assessment process.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTCumulative effects assessment (CEA) in Canada is in dire straits. Despite a huge amount of talk and a flurry of developmental activity associated with CEA concepts, it has not lived up to its glowing promise of helping to achieve sustainability of diverse valued ecosystem components. This article aims to articulate that failure, to examine it in terms of six major problems with CEA, and to propose solutions. The six problem areas include (1) application of CEA in project-level environmental impact assessments (EIAs), (2) an EIA focus on project approval instead of environmental sustainability, (3) a general lack of understanding of ecologic impact thresholds, (4) separation of cumulative effects from project-specific impacts, (5) weak interpretations of cumulative effects by practitioners and analysts, and (6) inappropriate handling of potential future developments. We advocate improvements not only within the purview of project-specific EIAs, but also mainly in the domain of region-scale CEAs and regional environmental effects frameworks (or perhaps land use planning). Only then will the CEA begin to approach the promise of securing sustainability of valued ecosystem components.},

  abstract = {Scenarios and scenario analysis have become popular approaches in organizational planning and participatory exercises in pursuit of sustainable development. However, they are little used, at least in any formal way, in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is puzzling because EIA is a process specifically dedicated to exploring options for more-sustainable (i.e., less environmentally damaging) futures. In this paper, we review the state of the art associated with scenarios and scenario analysis, and describe two areas where scenario analysis could be particularly helpful in EIA: (a) in defining future developments for cumulative effects assessment; and (b) in considering the influence of contextual change - e.g. climate change - on impact forecasts for specific projects. We conclude by encouraging EIA practitioners to learn about the promise of scenario-based analysis and implement scenario-based methods so that EIA can become more effective in fostering sustainable development.

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) became an increasingly important component of environmental impact assessment (EIA; or simply environment assessment (EA)) shortly after formal processes for EIA were established in North America in the 1970s. Despite a growing body of literature addressing science requirements of exemplary EIA and CEA, practice remains contested. Our mission in preparing this review was to provide a critical update on progress in scientific developments associated with CEA and also to guide practitioners to a broad selection of the recent relevant peer-reviewed formal literature on CEA. In addition, we point to ways in which guidance for CEA practice could be improved. The study canvassed widely for refereed papers in journals and edited books as far back as 2000. On the matter of key concepts related to CEA, the paper addresses the definition of other activities to be assessed, establishment of time and space bounds, impact thresholds, methods for impact prediction, and stressor-based versus effect-based approaches. Definitions of cumulative effect are reviewed, with encouragement for continued work to elaborate the concept. Contributions from science to CEA practice are identified as follows: retrospective and prospective investigative protocols; basic ecological knowledge; effects knowledge; tools and methods; ecological grounds for threshold establishment; and analytically competent practitioners. We observe that the plethora of CEA frameworks populating the scientific literature offer practitioners helpful ways to think about the CEA process. CEA methods are then reviewed, with specific emphasis on geographic information systems, scenario-building, thresholds, indicators, simulation, and public engagement. Several case examples of CEA in practice are summarized, with the observation that none of the published case studies arises from work done to support CEA that is part of the regulated EIA process. The paper reflects on the role of CEA in project-specific EIA (or project EA) as well as class EA, strategic EA, and regional EA. CEA is needed in all forms of EA, but it seems to be particularly difficult to implement well in project-specific EIAs. Recommendations for improvements in guidance materials for practitioners address definitions, scenarios, analytical methods, collaborative methods, thresholds, knowledge accumulation, accidents and malfunctions, project scale, and knowledge integration. We conclude that competent CEA is a vital requirement for securing the sustainability of valued ecosystems and their components.},

The sector is considered by UK Government as essential to the development of a low carbon economy and to meeting binding targets on carbon reduction and renewable energy generation. The Crown Estate, responsible for licensing development on the sea bed around the UK, has held three rounds of licensing since 2000 for wind developments. Some of the projects in the first two rounds suffered long delays due to uncertainty of project level impacts, particularly cumulative impacts. A number of key stakeholders identified a need for cumulative impact assessment (CIA) methodology to be developed that was definitive and endorsed by regulators and industry to aid unblocking barriers to delivery. This paper explores the background to the development of the guidelines and how they were `co-created' with industry and regulators. We evaluate to what extent they have been used to shape and develop practice.},

  abstract = {The social and environmental impacts of rapidly expanding coal and gas industries have generated high levels of public concern and there is increasing evidence of cumulative impacts. In the Bowen Basin of Queensland (Australia) water quality issues have triggered a collaborative response to coordinate monitoring efforts, integrate data and information and undertake regional analysis to inform landscape-scale management. Collaborative governance is promoted as a response to complex environmental problems, such as cumulative impacts. However, application of this approach to the resources and energy sectors remains a significant research gap. This paper reports the results of action research in the 2 years taken to negotiate the establishment of collaborative governance arrangements to address mine-water discharge impacts in the Bowen Basin. The long establishment phase has been required to refine objectives, build trust, develop governance mechanisms and secure resourcing commitments. The partnership established involves more than 20 organisations including regulators, resources and energy companies, agricultural industries and research organisations. The breadth of participating sectors is a significant innovation, but also represents a major challenge in establishing this model of regional environmental governance. Promising strategies adopted to manage these tensions have included neutral brokerage, facilitative leadership, establishing legitimacy of the collaboration and credibility of its reports. The case study provides a cautionary tale of the pursuit of the promise of `everyone working together' to address cumulative impacts. Policy implications include the need for extended commitment and integration of collaborative and other responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An important weakness is the inability to test effects predictions before they occur, and another weakness is infrequent follow-up monitoring providing information useful for post-development cumulative effects assessment and restoration or reclamation of lands and waters. Ideally, EEA is part of a comprehensive regional environmental planning and management process, falling between long-term regional planning and post-development protective regulation and restoration. Ecologically sound EEA and restoration within this greater context are best effected via reestablishing and maintaining landscape integrity. This, in turn, is managed best by ensuring reestablishment and maintenance of biodiversity and ecological processes in relation to the ecosystem components most valued by relevant human groups. The administrative process by means of which this environmental management goal may be effected must be flexible and adaptive so as to incorporate natural environmental change and human cultural dynamics.},

  abstract = {The mountain rivers of the Indian Himalaya possess a vast potential for hydropower generation. After decades of comparatively modest development recent years have seen a major intensification in the construction of new hydropower dams. Although increasingly portrayed as a form of renewable energy generation, hydropower development may lead to extensive alterations of fluvial systems and conflicts with resource use patterns of local communities. To appraise and reduce adverse effects is the purpose of statutory Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and corresponding mitigation plans. However, in the light of ambitious policies for hydropower expansion conventional approaches of environmental assessment are increasingly challenged to keep up with the intensity and pace of development. This paper aims to explore the systemic limitations of environmental assessment for hydropower development in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Based on a qualitative methodology involving interviews with environmental experts, document reviews and field observations the study suggests that the current practice of constraining ElAs to the project level fails to address the larger effects of extensive hydropower development. Furthermore, it is critically discussed as to what extent the concept of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) might have the potential to overcome existing shortcomings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Emilia-Romagna (E-R) Region belongs to one of the most industrialized coastal and sea areas of the Italian Northern Adriatic Sea, requiring adequate decision support instruments able to assist authorities to enforce ecosystem-based Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). In this research we combine Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA) model with marine ecosystem services capacity (MESCap) assessment of multiple ecological components (seabed habitats, essential fish habitats, marine mammals and turtles). The geospatial instruments were used for E-R Region's sea space to support the selection of spatially explicit measures to address two marine conservation objectives, i.e. A. preservation of essential fish habitats and B. protection of species of high conservation value, namely marine mammals and turtles, proposed within an MSP pilot study for the region. Results show that cumulative effects are mainly generated from trawling activities, maritime transport (e.g. Port of Ravenna), and by the influence of land-based activities (i.e. inputs from Po river and other minor rivers). Highest threats to marine ecosystem services (ES) were related to supporting ES (e.g. habitat and nursery provisioning) and to cultural ES. We discuss the contribution of the presented approach towards an ecosystem-based management in the region and the potential benefits that the integration of the ES concept can have in the designing of planning measures with the aim of reducing the cumulative effects and of maintaining marine ecological resources and services.},

  abstract = {Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) needs to incorporate spatial information on human impacts. As human activities and uses increase in marine and coastal waters around the world, pressures in ecosystems are also increasing, leading to multiple adverse effects on different species and habitats. The European Directive on MSP aims to achieve an integrated approach to marine governance, whilst securing and maintaining the healthy status of marine and coastal waters, in accordance with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The latter requires Member States to develop assessments not only on pressures and impacts, but also on the state of the marine environment and then take measures towards reaching a Good Environmental Status by 2020. The Portuguese Maritime Spatial Plan - Plano de Ordenamento do Espaco Matitimo (POEM) was developed between 2009 and 2012. In 2014 a law establishing the Basis for the Spatial Planning and Management of the National Maritime Space was enacted and in 2015 the framework for the elaboration of a new national Maritime Spatial Plan, named Situation Plan, was established. Portugal will face, in the next five years, the challenge of planning and managing its marine space, whilst promoting its sustainable use and protection. This study adapted a cumulative effects assessment model to understand how the impacts from multiple threats affect the marine and coastal ecosystems and, how this information can be used to improve the management process. Information was gathered on intensity and distribution of activities and uses for the Portuguese continental subdivision marine area, quantified and mapped their cumulative impacts in marine ecosystems, and overlapped with the POEM. Results show that impacts are spreading from the coast up to the Contiguous Zone. Higher scores appear in Transitional and Coastal Waters in the north (Viana do Castelo/Figueira da Foz), centre (Peniche/Settibal) and south (Lagos/Faro). In some areas with higher ranks, statutes of nature conservation are already in place, but potential activities may still occur on top of existing ones. This study shows that the adapted model is a helpful tool to clarify ocean planning, identify areas of potential conflicts among users and support the decision making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Accommodating sea uses while protecting the ecosystems is a challenge of the marine planning and management process. The European Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning calls for Maritime Spatial Plans until 2021 developed within an Ecosystem Based Management approach. The main goal of this study is to support the Maritime Spatial Planning process with ecological meaningful information, namely identifying priority areas for conservation that are facing less anthropogenic impacts. We developed a new approach for selection of high priority areas for conservation using Marxan software and Cumulative Impacts decision support tools. We identified four main areas prone to conservation in Portuguese mainland subdivision, namely the areas of Figueira da Foz/Peniche, south Cabo Espichel/Sines, Cabo Sarclao/Faro and Lagos/Faro. The outputs from this study show the valuable input when allocating space to activities and uses in the marine realm supporting the planning process in the development of management alternatives. This case study also illustrates how ecological goals can be better included to contribute to the Maritime Planning process in Portugal. Systematic planning can be applied to support the connection between Marine Strategy Framework and Maritime Spatial Planning European Directives. This is highly relevant in the time being for Portugal, as the 2nd cycles of both directives are ongoing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {By virtue of their linear nature, pipelines provide interesting dilemmas that one must face when determining how best to address project-related cumulative environmental effects. Effects from pipeline construction and operation can act in combination with other projects and activities such as resource extraction, recreational use, and other land-use practices to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The challenge is to first determine the environmental effects of the project. Three main types of disturbances stem from pipeline construction and operation: those concentrated around or emanating from a point or local area (e.g., temporary work spaces), a linear area (e.g., right-of-way), or a regional area (e.g., emissions from compressor stations). Pipeline projects can also be separated into several phases including planning, construction, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment. Each of the project phases and associated activities has the potential to adversely affect environmental values. Pipelines, being linear, provide interesting cumulative effects issues. Key cumulative effects issues include habitat loss and fragmentation, access creation and management, upstream induced effects, and watercourse crossings. To effectively assess pipeline cumulative effects stakeholders should follow an established cumulative effects assessment (CEA) framework or approach. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency's Cumulative Effects Assessment Practitioners Guide provides an example of a CEA framework that provides a starting point to assist the determination of the significance of cumulative effects as a result of pipeline development. As part of project-specific environmental assessments, the potential cumulative environmental effects are often identified, evaluated, mitigative measures proposed and the significance of effects assessed. Proper implementation of mitigative measures in the field is critical to the management of project-related cumulative effects. This paper argues that an overall CEA approach or framework for a pipeline project should be developed in a manner that is similar to a CEA for a non-linear project or non-pipeline project although it also recognizes that pipelines have some effects that are unique. Cumulative effects from pipelines can be managed by applying standard environmental assessment principles, using guidelines as frameworks to assist the undertaking of CEAs, and by ensuring mitigation is effectively applied.},

  abstract = {Assessing cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on the marine environment can help inform management response. This requires understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of human pressures and their impacts. Quantifying seabed recovery rates from 2 significant pressures in European waters, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction, is a significant step towards assessing sensitivity and cumulative impacts. Vessel monitoring system data were used to estimate the distribution and intensity of benthic fishing in UK (England and Wales) marine waters (2006 to 2007). Data were separated by towed bottom-fishing gears (scallop dredges, beam and otter trawls) and linked to habitat in a geographic information system. Recovery periods of seabed habitats were estimated by literature review, for gear types and fishing intensity. Recovery rates generally increased with sediment hardness, and habitats required longer periods of recovery from scallop dredging than from otter or beam trawling. Fishing pressure across the habitat-gear combinations was such that 80\% of the bottom-fished area was estimated to be able to recover completely before repeat trawling, based on mean annual trawl frequencies. However, in 19\% of the UK's bottom-fished seabed, scallop dredging in sand and gravel and otter trawling in muddy sand and reef habitats occurred at frequencies that prevented full habitat recovery. In 2007, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction occurred together in an estimated 40 km(2) (¡0.02\%) of the UK seabed. Cumulative impacts were estimated as total recovery time under 4 scenarios: greatest, additive, antagonistic and synergistic impacts. Recovery from aggregate extraction required much greater periods than from benthic fishing, and gravel was identified as a more sensitive habitat than sand.},

  abstract = {European Member States are required to assess the status of marine waters, including analysis of cumulative effects. We developed a methodology for evaluating the impact of several human activities that constitute 4 direct pressures on the UK (England and Wales) seabed community: smothering, abrasion, obstruction (sealing), and extraction. The method was tested by mapping the spatial extent of individual and cumulative activities for 2007 by habitat type, quantifying the intensity of activities, and estimating impact using published recovery times. More than half (134400~km2) of the seabed was directly affected by human activities, of which only 165 km2 ({$<$}0.1\%) was occupied by multiple activities. Benthic fishing accounted for 99.6\% of the spatial footprint. Sensitivity to the pressures of human activities varied by habitat type, with estimated recovery times ranging from {$<$}1 mo for otter trawling in sand, to \textasciitilde 15 yr for co-occurring aggregate extraction and dredge material disposal in low-energy gravel habitat. Fully integrated, dynamically-linked environmental assessments are generally considered desirable for greater scientific understanding of an ecosystem. The methodology we present for quantifying cumulative effects is a step towards this. However, our findings indicate that a limited number of activities were the predominant cause of widespread, long recovery times of benthic fauna. This suggests that when time and resources are limited, single sector assessment rather than detailed evaluation of cumulative effects, can still usefully guide management. As the observed cumulative effects were primarily related to a few activities, it might reasonably be argued that management effort should be focused on spatially extensive activities, such as benthic fishing to mitigate most of the human impact on the UK seabed.},

To counteract negative demographic and economic effects on pastoralism, knowledge about the historical and current status of the environment is essential. In this study, we show how extractive industries, especially large-scale mining, induced a cascade of land conversions which are affecting animal populations and pastoralists' adaptive responses in northern Sweden. We examine social-ecological vulnerability in Arctic reindeer husbandry by integrating herders' knowledge, population statistics for semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus, public data on socio-economic variables and geospatial tools. We determine that approximately 34\% of Laevas reindeer herding community's grazing grounds are functionally unavailable to reindeer at present due to the accumulation of multiple competing land use pressures. Reindeer numbers currently only remain stable due to increased management efforts. Moreover, we identified current hotspots of high cumulative impact and mineral exploration as the spatially dominating land use factor in this area. Our approach and results provide new insights for scientifically robust cumulative impact assessments of anthropogenic stressors by creating a baseline of current developments via a combination of reindeer herder's knowledge with historical data of trends and extents of human activity over the last century.},

  abstract = {The cumulative effects of increasing human use of the ocean and coastal zone have contributed to a rapid decline in ocean and coastal resources. As a result, scientists are investigating how multiple, overlapping stressors accumulate in the environment and impact ecosystems. These investigations are the foundation for the development of new tools that account for and predict cumulative effects in order to more adequately prevent or mitigate negative effects. Despite scientific advances, legal requirements, and management guidance, those who conduct assessments including resource managers, agency staff, and consultants continue to struggle to thoroughly evaluate cumulative effects, particularly as part of the environmental assessment process. Even though 45 years have passed since the United States National Environmental Policy Act was enacted, which set a precedent for environmental assessment around the world, defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance are still major challenges associated with assessing cumulative effects. In addition, we know little about how practitioners tackle these challenges or how assessment aligns with current scientific recommendations. To shed more light on these challenges and gaps, we-undertook a comparative study on how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is conducted by practitioners operating under some of the most well-developed environmental laws around the globe: California, USA; British Columbia, Canada; Queensland, Australia; and New Zealand. We found that practitioners used a broad and varied, definition of impact for CEA, which led to differences in how baseline, scale, and significance were determined. We also found that practice and science are not closely aligned and, as such, we highlight opportunities for managers, policy makers, practitioners, and scientists to improve environmental assessment.

  abstract = {Regional land use planning provides opportunities for governments, land users, and stakeholders to consider multiple land and resource interests over large geographic areas and meaningful time periods. The broad and integrative nature of regional planning is therefore well suited to assessing the potential cumulative effects of current and future land use activity. For this reason, cumulative effects assessment models and management concepts are playing an increasingly important role in regional planning. We describe how the ALCES (R) landscape cumulative effects simulation model was used to explore possible outcomes of an oil and gas scenario in the Eagle Plain basin of the North Yukon Planning Region of Yukon Territory, Canada. Scenario modeling was conducted to facilitate informed discussion about key land use issues and practices, potential levels of landscape change, and possible socioeconomic benefits and environmental impacts. Modeling results supported the sustainable development and cumulative effects management recommendations of the North Yukon Regional Land Use Plan. Land use scenario modeling, as applied in this project, was found to be an effective approach for establishing sustainable development guidelines through a regional planning process.},

  abstract = {The development of mineral and energy resources worldwide has placed pressure on regional environments, economies and communities. The cumulative impacts, or cumulative effects, arising from overlapping development have stretched political systems that have traditionally been geared toward the regulation and management of individual resource developments, presenting challenges for policy makers, resource developers and civil society actors. An equally challenging task has been realisation of the potential development dividends of mineral and energy resources in the areas of business development, infrastructure, human development or the management of resource revenues. This paper introduces a special issue on `Understanding and Managing Cumulative Impacts in Resource Regions'. The special issue interrogates the effectiveness of new and traditional policy responses, explores methods and strategies to better respond to cumulative impacts, and details practical examples of collaborative and coordinated approaches. Papers cover a range of environmental, economic and social issues, geographical regions, commodities, and conceptual approaches. This introductory paper introduces the cumulative impact issues that have manifest in resource regions, critically appraises current conceptions of cumulative impacts, and details management and policy responses to address the cumulative dimensions of impact.

  abstract = {Mounting evidence from both instrumental and proxy records shows global climate continues to change. Analysis of near-surface temperatures over land and oceans during the past 130 years shows marked warming during the first half of this century with relatively steady temperatures through the mid-1970s followed by a rapid warming during the 1980s. The source of this warming is unclear at present. The warmest decade in the recent record is the 1980s with some of the most pronounced warming occurring in the lower latitudes, including the Western Indian Ocean. In the context of this study, the important consequences of climate warming are: (1) the potential impacts associated with rising sea level due to thermal expansion of the oceans; (2) melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers; (3) the increased frequency, intensity, and seasonality of tropical storms and the monsoon season; and (4) changes in local land-use practices. Rising sea level, coupled with meteorological changes, creates a potential for increased coastal erosion and loss of coastal habitats such as wetlands, mangroves, and coral reef communities. These potential impacts may affect future land-use and development practices. For example, the curtailment of tourism could after economic growth and development. Forecasting the potential regional and local impacts of global warming is not a trivial problem. General circulation models presently do not provide the necessary fine-scale resolution required for ascertaining such smaller-scale effects. In addition, there is little agreement between the forecasts from different models of past, present, or future patterns on such fundamental climate variables as precipitation and air temperature. The absence of quality regional and local tide-gauge data of the appropriate duration necessary for calculating changes in the relative sea level exacerbates the existing theoretical uncertainty. Nevertheless, the potential impacts do represent present-day problems resulting from the alteration and acceleration of naturally occurring processes through man's activities. These types of future problems which typify the impacts forecast as a result of global warming are occurring now, partly because of human activities. Such insular impacts in the Western Indian Ocean region should be used by local governments as case studies for educating the populace, developing remedial activities, analyzing socioeconomic patterns, and formulating long-term management and policy strategies that will minimize unwanted future changes. Finally, a regional strategy is needed to address the following issues: (1) the acquisition and interpretation of tide-gauge and other geodetic data to provide estimates of the local and regional relative sea-level rise; (2) a plan to identify and suggest possible mitigation for regional and local activities (land use, economic development practices, industrial development etc.) that may directly contribute to enhanced global warming through the release of carbon dioxide and other radiatively active gases; (3) the development of regional and local policies (e.g. land use, coastal zoning, building setbacks, etc.) to minimize the impacts resulting from extant and possible future relative sea-level rise and meteorological changes; and (4) the linkages between potential changes in global (regional) climate and present anthropogenic stress upon the environment-that is, cumulative impact assessment. The challenge is to recognize the need for regional and local action in the absence of site-specific data, or scientific certainty.},

  abstract = {Cumulative risk assessments (CRAs) examine potential risks posed by exposure to multiple and sometimes disparate environmental stressors. CRAs are more resource intensive than single chemical assessments, and pose additional challenges and sources of uncertainty. CRAs may examine the impact of several factors on risk, including exposure magnitude and timing, chemical mixture composition, as well as physical, biological, or psychosocial stressors. CRAs are meant to increase the relevance of risk assessments, providing decision makers with information based on real world exposure scenarios that improve the characterization of actual risks and hazards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated a number of CRAs, performed by or commissioned for the Agency, to seek insight into CRA concepts, methods, and lessons learned. In this article, ten case studies and five issue papers on key CRA topics are examined and a set of lessons learned are identified for CRA implementation. The lessons address the iterative nature of CRAs, importance of considering vulnerability, need for stakeholder engagement, value of a tiered approach, new methods to assess multiroute exposures to chemical mixtures, and the impact of geographical scale on approach and purpose.

  abstract = {Antarctica, an area that is devoted to global peace and research, is being challenged by climate change, human activities, and pollution. There have been a number of studies concerning the state of the Antarctic ecological environment. However, a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the impact of threats on the Antarctica ecological environment is still lacking. In this study, a cumulative impact assessment performed on the basis of expert judgement was used to estimate species-specific differences on the impact of seven threats: climate change, organic and nonorganic pollutants, station construction, power generation, oil spilling, and tourism. The terrestrial area of the Fildes Peninsula was divided into 103 cells using a raster grid of 0.25 km(2), and cumulative impact assessment was applied to each cell. The analysis results indicated that cumulative impact scores (I-C) ranged from 0 to 39.4, and the cumulative scores were divided into six categories ranging from very low impact (I-C ¡= 7.08) to very high impact (I-C ¿ 20.54). More than half of the terrestrial area (57.3\%) experienced “Very Low Impact” or “Low impact” scores. For single factors, climate change was identified as a rapidly growing and significant threat facing the terrestrial ecosystems of Antarctica. In addition, tourism had the greatest impact among all human activities. The analytical process and resulting map indicate that it is necessary to develop international policies on the restriction of tourist activity space and strength the organic pollutant controls for terrestrial ecosystem protection in the Fildes Peninsula, Antarctica.},

  abstract = {Land take is emerging as a global environmental concern, and is particularly critical in intensively developed and land-scarce regions. This paper seeks to understand the effectiveness of the screening stage of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in addressing land take. Screening is the stage where a decision is made as to whether an EIA is required for a project. In many jurisdictions, screening results in three pathways: full EIA directly, preliminary EIA only, or preliminary EIA followed by full EIA. We compared the land take of 217 projects triggering the different pathways in a study region in Italy over a 15-year time interval. Land take was quantified by overlaying the footprint of the projects with a land cover map. The results show that while more attention was given to projects with larger land take impacts overall, the cumulative land take from smaller projects not triggering full EIA was considerable (40\% of overall land take). The case-by-case examination conducted through the preliminary EIA was found to work better for some project types (ski areas and small urban development), than for others (quarries). Our findings lead us to advocate improvements in current screening procedures to ensure that the land take impacts are quantified and made explicit in preliminary EIA reports. Our evidence-based approach to determining land take in EIA provides a compelling basis for understanding ways to improve EIA policies, guidance and practice.},

  abstract = {Urbanization typically leads to erosion and instability in rivers, and many management and restoration strategies have been developed to dampen the worst impacts. Stream power, defined as the rate of energy expenditure in a river, is a promising metric for analyzing cumulative effects. In this paper we describe a spatial decision support system called the Stream Power Index for Networks (SPIN) toolbox that can be used to assess urban river stability at a watershed scale. The objectives of the paper are to: a) describe the toolbox algorithms and procedures and b) demonstrate the utility of the approach. SPIN is written in Python and packaged as an ArcGIS toolbox. The toolbox combines existing landscape analysis algorithms with new algorithms to model river confluences, channel sinuosity, and threshold sediment particle sizes. Data can also be ingested from a standard hydraulic model. Two case studies demonstrate use of the toolbox to: i) anticipate current morphology; ii) predict urban morphologic change; and iii) analyze the benefits for stormwater management and channel restoration scenarios on channel stability.},

One of the largest challenges facing ERA methodologies and approaches is to develop the ability to encompass cumulative and far-field effects of human activities. It is argued here that the ERAs of industrial aquaculture activities have been an example of where ERA practitioners and researchers have responded to the challenge of managing the cumulative risks of a new and rapidly growing industry by developing innovative ERA approaches that can be applied elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Climate change (CC) is a key, global driver of change of marine ecosystems. At local and regional scales, other local human stressors (LS) can interact with CC and modify its effects on marine ecosystems. Understanding the response of the marine environment to the combined effects of CC and LS is crucial to inform marine ecosystem-based management and planning, yet our knowledge of the potential effects of such interactions is fragmented. At a global scale, we explored how cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) have addressed CC in the marine realm and discuss progress and shortcomings of current approaches. For this we conducted a systematic review on how CEAs investigated at different levels of biological organization ecological responses, functional aspects, and the combined effect of CC and HS. Globally, the effects of 52 LS and of 27 CC-related stressors on the marine environment have been studied in combination, such as industrial fisheries with change in temperature, or sea level rise with artisanal fisheries, marine litter, change in sediment load and introduced alien species. CC generally intensified the effects of LS at species level. At trophic groups and ecosystem levels, the effects of CC either intensified or mitigated the effects of other HS depending on the trophic groups or the environmental conditions involved, thus suggesting that the combined effects of CC and LS are context-dependent and vary among and within ecosystems. Our results highlight that large-scale assessments on the spatial interaction and combined effects of CC and LS remain limited. More importantly, our results strengthen the urgent need of CEAs to capture local-scale effects of stressors that can exacerbate climate-induced changes. Ultimately, this will allow identifying management measures that aid counteracting CC effects at relevant scales. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Eli's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15\% restoration target. However, the understanding of restoration as a management tool remains ambiguous at EU and Member State levels. As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a well-defined priority setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The “Methodological framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in Bulgaria” proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System (SES), to be embedded in the environmental policy framework. We extend the analogy between SES and the human body's system in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to inform restoration priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools at several levels: 1. Overall objective: the sustainability goals correspond to the TCM's objective of a healthy, balanced body 2, Restoration objectives and functioning: the desired ecosystem state can be better understood in analogy between the ecosystem structure and functioning framework for multiparametric optimization, and the TCM framework of Ying-Yang, Eight principles, Five elements and organs 3. Ecosystem monitoring: Integrated monitoring may benefit from comparison to TCM diagnostics 4. Ecosystem management approaches can benefit from the analogy to the TCM system of meridians We apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision making on restoration, streamlined ecosystem monitoring and a number of other issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas, defragmentation and connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.), are easier to understand, communicate, account for and manage. Ecosystem restoration is priority for China and the country has accumulated research and practical experience, including study of links between ecosystem management and the historical principles of Chinese philosophy. The Bulgarian and European approach to ecosystem based management can benefit from analogies to TCM. We derive policy recommendations by analogy, and illustrate them on the example of Natural Capital Accounting, (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessments (CEA) evolved to holistically understand and account for the impact of a spectrum of human and natural disturbances on ecosystems. Yet, the practice of CEA has struggled to overcome siloed and reductionist underpinnings common in the impact assessment arena. One way to move CEA towards more integrated approaches is by drawing on the concept of ecological resilience. Despite gaining considerable attention in other academic spheres, however, ecological resilience remains largely unexplored in CEAs. Motivated by this gap, the objective of this article is to explore how CEAs can be reimagined through an ecological resilience lens to cultivate more integrated and holistic CEA practices. We provide a brief synthesis of CEA theory and practice, highlighting where reductionist, disciplinary, and siloed approaches prevail. Then, we explore three shifts that could recast CEA through the concept of ecological resilience: (1) a shift from valued ecological components to values/identity (resilience pivots), (2) a shift from baseline assessments to ecological trajectories, and (3) a shift from management thresholds to safe operating spaces. We argue that intersecting the practice of CEA with the concept of ecological resilience offers a real opportunity to extend beyond simply being passive respondents to an incremental “death by 1000 cuts” to cultivating the conditions needed for ecological adaption and transformation along desirable pathways.},

In July 2015, the World Heritage Committee called attention to the cumulative impacts of climate change, poor water quality, and coastal development on the region's outstanding universal value, but stopped short of inscribing the Great Barrier Reef on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Restoring the region's values is hindered by an environmental decision-making process that fails to incorporate cumulative impacts, including the climate change impacts of greenhouse gas emissions sourced from one of Australia's largest exports, thermal coal. We identify policy and processes that enable a more comprehensive consideration of the cumulative effects of coal mining by environmental decision-makers. Implementing cumulative impact assessment requires a collaborative and transparent program of planning and monitoring independent of Government and mine proponents that evaluates local, regional, and global impacts. The future of the Great Barrier Reef depends on transformational change in the cumulative assessment of Australian coal mines.},

  abstract = {The constraints to assessing and managing cumulative environmental effects in the context of project-based environmental assessment are well documented, and the potential benefits of a more strategic approach to cumulative effects assessment (CEA) are well argued; however, such benefits have yet to be clearly demonstrated in practice. While it is widely assumed that cumulative effects are best addressed in a strategic context, there has been little investigation as to whether CEA and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) are a ‘good fit’ — conceptually or methodologically. This paper identifies a number of conceptual and methodological challenges to the integration of CEA and SEA. Based on results of interviews with international experts and practitioners, this paper demonstrates that: definitions and conceptualizations of CEA are typically weak in practice; approaches to effects aggregation vary widely; a systems perspective lacks in both SEA and CEA; the multifarious nature of SEA complicates CEA; tiering arrangements between SEA and project-based assessment are limited to non-existing; and the relationship of SEA to regional planning remains unclear.},

  abstract = {The North Sea basin is one of the busiest maritime areas globally with a considerable number of anthropogenic pressures impacting the functioning of the marine ecosystem. Due to growing EU ambitions for the deployment of large offshore wind farm projects (OWF), as part of the 2050 renewable energy roadmap, there is a key need for a holistic understanding of OWF potential impacts on the marine ecosystem. We propose a holistic Cumulative Effect Assessment methodology, applied using a geo-spatial open-source software, to assess impacts of OWF related pressures on selected seabed habitats, fish, seabird and mammal species. We take into account pressures specific to the three OWF development phases, spanning 1999-2050, for the entire North Sea basin. Our results underline 2022 as the peak year of cumulative impacts for the approved OWFs, followed by a considerable increase in potential impacts of the planned 212GWs, by 2050. The spatio-temporal analysis of the OWF environmental impacts presents the shift between highly impacted areas over the studied timeline and distinguishes between concentrated areas of high impacts (S-E of UK) and dispersed areas of high impacts (Germany). Our results can inform decision-makers and the OWF industry in a joint effort to mitigate the environmental impacts of future large OWF developments.},

  abstract = {Marine mammals are vulnerable to a variety of acute and chronic anthropogenic stressors, potentially experiencing these in isolation, successively and/or simultaneously. Formal assessment of the likely impact(s) of the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a defined population is carried out through a Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA), which is a mandatory component of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in many countries. However, for marine mammals, the information required to feed into CEA, such as thresholds for disturbance, frequency of multiple (and simultaneous) exposures, interactions between stressors, and individual variation in response, is extremely limited, though our understanding is slowly improving. The gaps in knowledge make it challenging to effectively quantify and subsequently assess the risk of individual and population consequences of multiple disturbances in the form of a CEA. To assess the current state of practice for assessing cumulative effects on marine mammals within UK waters, 93 CEAs were reviewed across eleven maritime industries. An objective framework of thirteen evaluative criteria was used to score each assessment on a scale of 13-52 (weak - strong). Scores varied significantly by industry. On average, the aquaculture industry produced the lowest scoring CEAs, whilst the large offshore windfarm industry (¿= 20 turbines) scored highest, according to the scoring criteria used. There was a significant increase in scores over the sample period (2009-2019), though this was mostly attributed to five industries (cable, large and small offshore wind farms, tidal and wave energy). There was inconsistency in the language used to define and describe cumulative effects and a lack of routinely applied methodology. We use the findings presented here, along with a wider review of the literature, to provide recommendations and discussion points aimed at supporting the standardisation and improvement of CEA practice. Although this research focused on how marine mammals were considered within UK CEAs, recommendations made are broadly applicable to assessments conducted for other receptors, countries and/or environments. Adoption of these proposals would help to ensure a more consistent approach, and would aid decision-makers and practitioners in mitigating any potential impacts, to ensure conservation objectives of marine mammal populations are not compromised.},

  abstract = {Claims for ocean space are growing while marine ecosystems suffer from centuries of insufficient care. Human pressures from runoff, atmospheric emissions, marine pollution, fishing, shipping, military operations and other activities wear on habitats and populations. Ecosystem-based marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged worldwide as a strategic instrument for handling conflicting spatial claims among competing sectors and the environment. The twofold objective of both boosting the blue economy and protecting the environment is challenging in practice and marine planners need decision support. Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) was originally developed to provide an overview of the human imprint on the world's ocean ecosystems. We have now added a scenario component to the CIA model and used it within Swedish ecosystem-based MSP. This has allowed us to project environmental impacts for different planning alternatives throughout the planning process, strengthening the integration of environmental considerations into strategic decision-making. Every MSP decision may entail a local shift of environmental impact, causing positive or negative consequences for ecosystem components. The results from Swedish MSP in the North Sea and Baltic Sea illustrate that MSP certainly has the potential to lower net cumulative environmental impact, both locally and across sea basins, as long as environmental values are rated high and prevailing pressures derive from activities that are part of MSP. By synthesizing innumerous data into comprehensible decision support that informs marine planners of the likely environmental consequences of different options, CIA enables ecosystem-based MSP in practice.},

  abstract = {This study provides a portrait of the state of impact assessment (IA) research for four types of low carbon power production (wind, solar, small-scale hydro and small modular nuclear reactors). The emphasis is on IA research that has relevance to the Canadian policy setting. The method involved a systematized scan of the academic literature (peer reviewed publications, conference proceedings and book chapters) and reports and studies produced by government and other organizations. The literature was categorized according to a framework adapted from transition theory. The results indicate that the literature addressing wind power is comprehensive, but there is a relative scarcity of research (in both quantity and breadth) on the impacts of solar, small-scale hydro, and small modular reactors (SMRs). In each of these three energy areas there is a lack of available work addressing the social, political and cultural impacts accompanied by more specialized gaps in the biophysical research. Drawing on a transition theory typology, the majority of the literature can be characterized as reflexive, with less than 20\% of research exploring primarily operational, tactical, or strategic themes. But there are many sources where the research contains overlapping categories. The research for SMR impacts is distinct from the other three alternative power sources; this literature is largely strategic. Priorities for further analysis in the short-term include applying lessons from the international literature to the Canadian context and developing a better understanding of the specific impacts of alternative energy sources on Indigenous communities. In the longer term, there is a need for more research in the field, with a particular emphasis on understanding the operational and strategic qualifies of low carbon power production.},

  abstract = {Context: Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) are important tools for supporting evidence-based decision making. However, most ERA frameworks rarely consider complex ecological feedbacks, which limit their capacity to evaluate risks at community and ecosystem levels of organisation.Method: We used qualitative mathematical modelling to add additional perspectives to previously conducted ERAs for the rehabilitation of the Ranger uranium mine (Northern Territory, Australia) and support an assess-ment of the cumulative risks from the mine site. Using expert elicitation workshops, separate qualitative models and scenarios were developed for aquatic and terrestrial systems. The models developed in the workshops were used to construct Bayes Nets that predicted whole-of-ecosystem outcomes after components were perturbed.Results: The terrestrial model considered the effect of fire and weeds on established native vegetation that will be important for the successful rehabilitation of Ranger. It predicted that a combined intervention that suppresses both weeds and fire intensity gave similar response predictions as for weed control alone, except for lower levels of certainty to tall grasses and fire intensity in models with immature trees or tall grasses. However, this had ambiguous predictions for short grasses and forbs, and tall grasses in models representing mature vegetation. The aquatic model considered the effects of magnesium (Mg), a key solute in current and predicted mine runoff and groundwater egress, which is known to adversely affect many aquatic species. The aquatic models provided support that attached algae and phytoplankton assemblages are the key trophic base for food webs. It predicted that shifts in phytoplankton abundance arising from increase in Mg to receiving waters, may result in cascading effects through the food-chain.Conclusion: The qualitative modelling approach was flexible and capable of modelling both gradual (i.e. decadal) processes in the mine-site restoration and the comparatively more rapid (seasonal) processes of the aquatic ecosystem. The modelling also provides a useful decision tool for identifying important ecosystem sub-systems for further research efforts.},

A vital aspect of an EIA process is consideration of the accumulation of impacts from multiple activities and stressors through a cumulative effects assessment (CEA). An opportunity exists to improve the rigor and utility of CEA and EIA by incorporating core scientific principles of landscape ecology into EIA. With examples from a Canadian context, we explore realistic hypothetical situations demonstrating how integration of core scientific principles could impact EIA outcomes. First, we demonstrate how changing the spatial extent of EIA boundaries can misrepresent cumulative impacts via the exclusion or inclusion of surrounding natural resource development projects. Second, we use network analysis to show how even a seemingly small, localized development project can disrupt regional habitat connectivity. Lastly, we explore the benefits of using long-term historical remote sensing products. Because these approaches are straightforward to implement using publicly available data, they provide sensible opportunities to improve EIA and enhance the monitoring of natural resource development activities in Canada and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a potential approach to the assessment of cumulative effects that may be adopted for larger federally regulated pipelines in Canada. The approach is based on a process originally developed for pipelines in the Rocky Mountain foothills of western Canada; therefore, the environmental components selected reflect some that are common for that region. The approach is based on the author's experiences in conducting cumulative effects assessments in Canada. Conditions or “triggers” are discussed under which cumulative effects need to be considered for a pipeline project, establishing an effects-based approach for assessing only those portions of the pipeline potentially contributing to cumulative effects. This establishes a focused approach that clearly identifies the scope of assessment. Specific pipeline effects that typically contribute to regional cumulative effects issues are identified, and approaches for assessing the significance of project contributions to such effects are broadly discussed.},

The decisions to be made include those (i) necessary to construct planning and regulatory frameworks to control development activity so that societal goals will be achieved and (ii) whether or not to approve individual development projects, with or without conditions. The evolution of CEA into a more successful tool cannot occur independently of the evolution of decision making processes. Currently progress is painfully slow on both fronts. This paper explores some opportunities to accelerate improvements in decision making in natural resource management and in the utility of CEA as a tool to assist in making such decisions. The focus of the paper is on how to define the public interest by determining what is acceptable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) methods promote the use of a conceptual site: model (CSM) to apportion exposures and integrate risk from multiple stressors. While CSMs may,encompass multiple species, evaluating end points across taxa can be challenging due to data availability and physiological differences among organisms. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) describe biological mechanisms leading to adverse outcomes (AOs) by assembling causal pathways with measurable intermediate steps termed key events (KEs), thereby providing a framework for integrating data across species. In this work, we used a case study focused on the perchlorate anion (ClO4-) to highlight the value of the AOP framework for cross-species data integration. Computational models and dose response data were used to evaluate the effects of ClO4- in 12 species and revealed a concordance across KEs and taxa. The aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) tracks stressors from sources to the exposures and serves as a complement to the AOP. We discuss how the combined AEP-AOP construct helps to maximize the use of existing data and advances CRA by (1) organizing toxicity and exposure data, (2) providing a mechanistic framework of KEs for integrating data across human health and ecological end points, (3) facilitating cross-species dose response evaluation, and (4) highlighting data gaps and technical limitations.},

  abstract = {Exposure to environmental contaminants can lead to adverse outcomes in both human and nonhuman receptors. The Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) frameworks can mechanistically inform cumulative risk assessment for human health and ecological end points by linking together environmental transport and transformation, external exposure, toxicokinetics, and toxicodynamics. This work presents a case study of a hypothetical contaminated site to demonstrate a quantitative approach for implementing the AEP framework and linking this framework to AOPs. We construct an AEP transport and transformation model and then quantify external exposure pathways for humans, fishes, and small herbivorous mammals at the hypothetical site. A Monte Carlo approach was used apportionment was quantified for each species, and published pharmacokinetic models were used to exposure from external exposures. Published dose response data for a multispecies AOP network were used to interpret AEP results in the context of species-specific effects. This work demonstrates (1) the construction, analysis, and application of a quantitative AEP model, (2) the utility of AEPs for organizing mechanistic exposure data and highlighting data gaps, and (3) the advantages provided by a source-to-outcome construct for leveraging exposure data and to aid transparency regarding assumptions.},

  abstract = {In Canada, the assessment of cumulative effects, incremental and accumulating environmental changes in a region over time, emerged from environmental impact assessment, which was designed to serve the ethos of western, `settler' governments despite being practiced in areas that usually overlap Indigenous territories. The limited (western) purview of cumulative effects assessment is reinforced by a lack of diversity in water monitoring and management practitioners. Our objective is to develop a new approach, collaborative watershed analysis, in which diverse ways of knowing are considered in the assessment of cumulative effects in water quality monitoring. An online workshop and 21 interviews informed how Canadian water managers, community members, and Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) peoples may collaborate to assess cumulative effects in the lower Grand River and the nearshore of Lake Erie (eastern basin in Ontario, Canada). Our results and discussion progress from western perspectives of `what is' to a broader discussion of `what could be', drawing on the perspectives of Haudenosaunee youth in the Grand River Watershed. We propose three recommendations for the creation of a cumulative effects monitoring framework: (1) co-create the intent and expectations of the monitoring program with all participants at the outset; (2) ensure diverse persons are invited to contribute; and (3) enable the sharing of knowledge in different formats. Strengths of collaborative watershed analysis include connecting biophysical aspects of the watershed with social, economic, and cultural aspects, as well as repositioning diverse ways of knowing as a foundation upon which cumulative impacts can be better understood and managed.

  abstract = {Climate is changing at an unprecedented rate with impacts being felt in social and ecological systems around the world. Opportunities for building climate resilience of the social-ecological system surrounding freshwater areas are assessed using the aquatic monitoring and reporting programs of Muskoka River Watershed (Ontario, Canada) as a case study. A three-step study design was used: establishment of a knowledge baseline (i.e., what has been done), confirmation of the baseline to ensure perspectives that emerged were inclusive of multiple stakeholders (i.e., broadly applicable) and an exploratory workshop to disseminate recommendations and discuss implementation with key stakeholders. Two themes are discussed: the strengthening of watershed-scale monitoring approaches, and improved communication with stakeholders (e.g., through `state of the watershed' reporting). This study offers an evaluation of watershed-scale aquatic monitoring and reporting and provides concrete examples from the case study. We test a new process for refining, selecting, or prioritizing indicators for aquatic monitoring. Cumulative effects assessment and monitoring (CEAM) is considered as the suggested monitoring approach at a watershed-scale. Recommendations for developing CEAM in the Muskoka River Watershed include considerations for selection of monitoring indicators, consistent communication of indicators, and implementing a metadatabase. Ways to enhance education of, and engagement with, local stakeholders through improved `state of the watershed' report cards are highlighted. Resilience is strengthened by addressing two goals in the case study: engaging with the community and improving knowledge of stressor-effect relationships in the watershed via stronger aquatic monitoring.},

Extensive research has investigated the consequences of multiple stressors on organisms, frequently focusing on individual life stages. Less is known about population-level consequences of exposure to multiple stressors, especially when exposure varies through life. We provide the first theoretical basis for identifying species at risk of magnified effects from multiple stressors across life history. By applying a population modeling framework, we reveal conditions under which population responses from stressors applied to distinct life stages are either magnified (synergistic) or mitigated. We find that magnification or mitigation critically depends on the shape of density dependence, but not the life stage in which it occurs. Stressors are always magnified when density dependence is linear or concave, and magnified or mitigated when it is convex. Using Bayesian numerical methods, we estimated the shape of density dependence for eight species across diverse taxa, finding support for all three shapes.},

  abstract = {Many of the world’s ecosystems are experiencing a suite of changes from anthropogenic activities; the multiple stressors from those activities result in cumulative impacts. Understanding how these activities translate into ecological consequences is exceedingly challenging because of the inherent complexity within natural systems and the variability in how stressors act and species respond. While there have been substantial advancements within the field of cumulative effects assessment to address these issues and improve our understanding of the consequences of our actions, many challenges in remain. Here, we detail advances and remaining challenges, and propose five priorities for addressing these challenges in the near future. In particular, we suggest prioritizing risk-based approaches that account for uncertainty in our understanding, and establishing underlying theory for when we expect particular impacts to occur. We also propose the need for a defined subdiscipline focused on cumulative effects, to help reduce the silos of research that are often disconnected, and to work towards a common set of definitions, methods and consistent use of open-data.},

  abstract = {Species, habitats, and ecosystems are increasingly exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors, fueling a rapidly expanding research program to understand the cumulative impacts of these environmental modifications. Since the 1970s, a growing set of methods has been developed through two parallel, sometimes connected, streams of research within the applied and academic realms to assess cumulative effects. Past reviews of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) methods focused on approaches used by practitioners. Academic research has developed several distinct and novel approaches to conducting CEA. Understanding the suite of methods that exist will help practitioners and academics better address various ecological foci (physiological responses, population impacts, ecosystem impacts) and ecological complexities (synergistic effects, impacts across space and time). We reviewed 6 categories of methods (experimental, meta-analysis, single-species modeling, mapping, qualitative modeling, and multispecies modeling) and examined the ability of those methods to address different levels of complexity. We focused on research gaps and emerging priorities. We found that no single method assessed impacts across the 4 ecological foci and 6 ecological complexities considered. We propose that methods can be used in combination to improve understanding such that multimodel inference can provide a suite of comparable outputs, mapping methods can help prioritize localized models or experimental gaps, and future experiments can be paired from the outset with models they will inform.},

  abstract = {Ecotoxicological effect studies often expose test organisms under optimal environmental conditions. However, organisms in their natural settings rarely experience optimal conditions. On the contrary, during most of their lifetime they are forced to cope with sub-optimal conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress. Interactions between the effects of a natural stressor and a toxicant can sometimes result in greater effects than expected from either of the stress types alone. The aim of the present review is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on the interactions between effects of “natural” and chemical (anthropogenic) stressors. More than 150 studies were evaluated covering stressors including heat, cold, desiccation, oxygen depletion, pathogens and immunomodulatory factors combined with a variety of environmental pollutants. This evaluation revealed that synergistic interactions between the effects of various natural stressors and toxicants are not uncommon phenomena. Thus, synergistic interactions were reported in more than 50\% of the available studies on these interactions. Antagonistic interactions were also detected, but in fewer cases. Interestingly, about 70\% of the tested chemicals were found to compromise the immune system of humans as judged from studies on human cell lines. The challenge for future studies will therefore be to include aspects of combined stressors in effect and risk assessment of chemicals in the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Urban agglomeration, which is an organism with distinct organizational characteristics, differs from a single city. In its policy-level environmental impact assessment, the ecological and health risks need to be addressed in a unified manner, because multiple cities interact and influence each other, and the environmental risks have multiple elements, multiple processes, and multiple effect interaction and superposition. To this end, this study proposed a regional-level cumulative risk assessment framework coupling a relative risk model (RRM) with a multi-media fugacity model (MFM). The RRM translated the risk causal relations into four city-differentiated matrices, which consisted of normalized factors (NFs), ranging from 0 to 1, that were indicative of the impact intensity and possibility. The MFM was embedded into the RRM to generate the NFs. The NFs were multiplied for each city-source-endpoint combination to get the overall risk score, and the score provided policy references. This framework was applied to Guangdong Province of China (GD). As heavy metal contamination is one of the GD's major concerns, this study analyzed their cumulative risks due to industrialization for the year 2020 and compared the city level and industrial level risk scores. The results showed that the central part of GD was under the highest risk, with Guangzhou, Foshan, and Jiangmen having the highest risk. From the perspective of the risk pressure sources, Pb and Cd were the biggest stressors. Non-ferrous/ferrous metals mining and processing and metal products manufacturing were the major threats. As these industries gain greater footholds in the GD's ecologically susceptible region, the relevant policies should be elaborately designed before new entrants commence their operations.},

  abstract = {Decisions about whether to approve fossil fuel projects have major implications for climate change, biodiversity, and Indigenous rights. In Canada, cumulative effects tend to be only weakly assessed, with each project reviewed on its own terms. This paper investigates how fossil fuel companies strategically define project boundaries to facilitate resource extraction. Drawing on a preliminary scan of applications to Canadian federal review bodies from 2010 to 2022, complemented by detailed document analysis of three selected cases, we ask: in what ways have oil and gas proponents actively constructed scale through their project plans - with what consequences for regulatory scrutiny? Through careful reading of project applications, hearing documents, and company websites, we identify three strategies: (1) splitting work on the same infrastructure into multiple applications; (2) incrementally expanding a network; and (3) portraying interdependent facilities as stand-alone projects. These tactics are within the law, yet they narrow the scope of issues that regulators assess and make it more onerous for affected communities to participate in multiple reviews. Case studies of the Line 9 pipeline, BC Pipeline network, and Gazoduq/' Energie Saguenay facilities show how regulators exempted smaller projects from more rigorous assessment, deemed cumulative effects assessment unnecessary, and excluded broader issues such as climate change and successive encroachment on Indigenous lands. Our findings contribute to work on the material consequences of relational scale, decolonial critiques of Canada's environmental governance regime, and efforts to advance climate justice by articulating how the legal geographies of energy projects shape responsibility for climate action.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the benefits and costs of hydropower development in the Mekong River Basin. We compare four major reports-the Mekong River Commission's (MRC's) Basin Development Plan Programme, Phase 2 (BDP2), the Strategic Environmental Assessment of Hydropower on the Mekong Mainstream (SEA), the Study on the Impacts of Mainstream Hydropower on the Mekong River (MDS), and the MRC's recent council study (CS)-in order to provide the basis for a comparative analysis of the major impact evaluation literature on mainstream dam construction in the Mekong River Basin for the period of 2010-2018. The primary objective of the review is to identify points of agreement, disagreement, inconsistency, and knowledge gaps. Both Mekong River Commission reports (BDP2 and CS) suggest extensive economic benefits for proposed hydropower development, whereas the SEA and MDS indicate that the net impact would be negative. The projected impacts of hydropower development on fisheries, sediment flows, and ecosystems vary widely both in economic and biophysical terms. However, all four reports point to decreased food security and loss of local livelihoods for millions of people as major concerns related to dam development. While considerable resources have been devoted to producing these important studies, the lack of standardization across reports, especially assumptions and methodologies for economic impacts, frustrates efforts at meaningful comparison of their findings and precludes the prospect of clear analytical outcomes or policy impacts.

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of offshore windfarms (OWFs) globally, there is an urgent need to assess and predict effects on marine species, habitats, and ecosystem functioning. Doing so at shelf-wide scale while simultaneously accounting for the concurrent influence of climate change will require dynamic, multitrophic, multiscalar, ecosystem-centric approaches. However, as such studies and the study system itself (shelf seas) are complex, we propose to structure future environmental research according to the investigative cycle framework. This will allow the formulation and testing of specific hypotheses built on ecological theory, thereby streamlining the process, and allowing adaptability in the face of technological advancements (e.g. floating offshore wind) and shifting socio-economic and political climates. We outline a strategy by which to accelerate our understanding of environmental effects of OWF development on shelf seas, which is illustrated throughout by a North Sea case study. Priorities for future studies include ascertaining the extent to which OWFs may change levels of primary production; whether wind energy extraction will have knock-on effects on biophysical ecosystem drivers; whether pelagic fishes mediate changes in top predator distributions over space and time; and how any effects observed at localized levels will scale and interact with climate change and fisheries displacement effects.},

  abstract = {Along migration corridors, animals can face natural and anthropogenic threats that differ from those in breeding and non-breeding residence areas. Satellite telemetry can aid in describing the timing and location of these migrations. We use this tool with switching state-space modeling and line kernel density estimates to identify migration corridors of post-nesting adult female loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta, n = 89 tracks) that nested at five beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. Turtles migrated in both neritic and oceanic areas of the Gulf of Mexico with some exiting the Gulf. High-use migration corridors were found in neritic areas to the west of Florida and also in the Florida Straits. Repeat tracking of post-nesting migrations for eight turtles showed variability in track overlap, ranging from similar to 13 to 82\% of tracks within 10 km of each other. Migration primarily occurred in July and August. We document the longest known post-nesting migration to-date of a wild adult female loggerhead of ¿4,300 km, along with an apparent stopover of about 1 month. Migration corridors overlaid on three spatially explicit anthropogenic threats (shipping density, commercial line fishing, and shrimp trawling) showed hotspots in the Florida Straits, off the northwest Florida coast and off the coast of Tampa Bay. Identifying where and at what intensity multiple human activities and natural processes most likely occur is a key goal of Cumulative Effects Assessments. Our results provide the scientific information needed for designing management strategies for this threatened species. Information about this loggerhead migration corridor can also be used to inform adaptive management as threats shift over time.},

During 2016-2017, a government-appointed panel toured Canada and received ¿ 1000 suggestions from diverse sectors of society regarding EA reform. Yet, different sectors of society may have different views concerning scientific components of EA. We analyzed written submissions during public consultation (categorized into five sectors) regarding five key scientific components of EA: (1) openly sharing information, (2) evaluating cumulative effects, (3) scientific rigour, (4) transparency in decision-making, and (5) independence between regulators and proponents. On the whole, submissions from Indigenous groups, non-governmental organizations, and individuals/academics supported strengthening all five components. In contrast, most contributions from industry/industry associations, and, to a lesser extent, government bodies or agencies, suggested that there was no need for increased scientific rigour or increased independence. These findings indicate that there is cross-sectoral support for strengthening some scientific aspects of EA. However, the degree to which the Government of Canada strengthens the scientific rigour and independence of EA will indicate whether environmental decision-making in Canada is aligned with preferences from industry or the rest of Canada.},

Local impacts are often treated superficially, and landscape-scale effects are usually neglected. 5.1 EIAs of road projects are generally poor. 5.2 Landscape-scale effects of road networks are neglected in EIAs. 5.3 There is a lack of knowledge of thresholds in the cumulative effects of landscape fragmentation and habitat loss on the viability of wildlife populations. 5.4 Wildlife populations may have long response times to increases in landscape fragmentation ('extinction debt'). 5.5 There are large uncertainties about many potential ecological effects of roads; they need explicit consideration in EIA. and decision-makers should more rigorously apply the precautionary principle. 5.6 Landscape fragmentation should be monitored because it is a threat to biodiversity and a relevant pressure indicator. 5.7 Maintaining ecological corridor networks is less costly than paying for their restoration at a later date. 5.8 Limits to control landscape fragmentation are needed. 5.9 Caring about the quality of the entire landscape is essential, not just protected areas and wildlife corridors. Major efforts are necessary to improve the quality of project-specific EIAs, landscape-scale cumulative effect assessment (CEA), strategic environmental assessment (SEA), road planning, and land-use planning. Given that road networks subdivide wildlife populations into a patchwork of sub-populations, futuro studies should directly address ecological effects at the landscape scale.},

  abstract = {As a precursor to developing a biomonitoring program for rivers of the Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland, this study characterized and compared the benthic macroinvertebrate communities and water chemistry in 5 remote, previously undescribed, rivers near Fort Severn, Ontario, Canada. The pH of river water ranged from 8.1 to 8.7, total phosphorus from 11 to 26 mu g L-1, dissolved organic carbon from 8 to 12 mg L-1, and chloride from 56 to 153 mg L-1. A total of 57 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa were represented, and the 10 most numerically dominant were the Chironominae (26 \% of collected individuals), Orthocladiinae (16 \%), oligochaetous clitellata (9 \%), Hyalellidae (7 \%), Hydropsychidae (6 \%), Gammaridae (5 \%), Elmidae (5 \%), Sphaeriidae/Pisidiidae (4 \%), Nemata (3 \%), and Tanypodinae (3 \%). Rivers' positions in ordinations of chemical and biological datasets were similar, suggesting that water chemistry has a role in structuring riverine benthic communities in the study region. Correlations between water-chemistry or habitat predictors and site-scores in the ordination of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa counts suggested that biological community structure was most associated with river-water pH, nutrient concentrations (e.g., total phosphorus, nitrogenous compounds, dissolved organic carbon, calcium, and silicate), the relative abundance of submerged macrophytes, conductivity (i.e., the concentrations of chloride and various other dissolved ions), and several geomorphological variables (e.g., bank-full river width, current speed, and the size of the dominant inorganic particles in the pavement layer of the streambed). Interest in mineral extraction and other resource-based exploration in Ontario's Far North is increasing. This study represents a start on baseline characterization for ecological monitoring and cumulative effects assessment that should proceed along with northern development.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is a sub-discipline of environmental impact assessment that is concerned with appraising the collective effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment. Aspirations for CEA have been expressed by many authors since 1969, when the foundation of environmental appraisal was laid by the US National Environmental Policy Act. This paper’s purposes are (i) to review aspirations for CEA, relative to current practice; and (ii) to fully explain and critique the logic that connects CEA’s operational steps and underlying philosophies. A literature review supports the following statements: Some conceptualizations emphasize the delivery of information to support decision making as the key purpose of CEA; others deem collaboration, debate, and learning as most important. Consensus on CEA’s operational steps has been reached, but each step requires practitioners to make analytical decisions (e.g., about the scope of issues to include or the time horizon to consider) and objective rules for how to approach those decisions are lacking. Numerical methods for assessing cumulative effects are largely available, meaning that CEA’s biggest problems are not scientific. CEA cannot succeed without substantive public engagement, monitoring, and adaptive management. CEA is best undertaken regionally, rather than project-by-project. CEA and planning are complementary, and should be merged. In its most enlightened form, CEA is a useful tool for ensuring that human undertakings ultimately conform to Earth’s finite biosphere, but current practice falls short of the ideal, and CEA’s logical derivation is not entirely sound. As regards CEA’s big problems, sustainability has not been defined clearly enough to make criteria for judging the significance of cumulative effects indisputable; legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks are poorly aligned for CEA; and objective criteria for judging the adequacy of CEA’s scope, scale, and thresholds do not exist, which makes the question of how to provide general guidance to practitioners intractable. Recommendations call for sustainability goals to be clearly expressed as measurable targets. Furthermore, precaution in human enterprise should be exercised by avoiding, minimizing, restoring, and offsetting negative cumulative effects. CEA can assist by quantifying and optimizing trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) a type of environmental appraisal lacks effective methods for modeling cumulative effects, evaluating indicators of ecosystem condition, and exploring the likely outcomes of development scenarios. Random forests are an extension of classification and regression trees, which model response variables by recursive partitioning. Random forests were used to model a series of candidate ecological indicators that described lakes and rivers from a case study watershed (The Muskoka River Watershed, Canada). Suitability of the candidate indicators for use in cumulative effects assessment and watershed monitoring was assessed according to how well they could be predicted from natural habitat features and how sensitive they were to human land-use. The best models explained 75\% of the variation in a multivariate descriptor of lake benthic-macroinvertebrate community structure, and 76\% of the variation in the conductivity of river water. Similar results were obtained by cross-validation. Several candidate indicators detected a simulated doubling of urban land-use in their catchments, and a few were able to detect a simulated doubling of agricultural land-use. The paper demonstrates that random forests can be used to describe the combined and singular effects of multiple stressors and natural environmental factors, and furthermore, that random forests can be used to evaluate the performance of monitoring indicators. The numerical methods presented are applicable to any ecosystem and indicator type, and therefore represent a step forward for CEA. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of human impacts on marine environments is necessary for maintaining healthy ecosystems and supporting `blue economies'. Realistic assessments of impact must consider the cumulative impacts of multiple, coincident threats and the differing vulnerabilities of ecosystems to these threats. Expert knowledge is often used to assess impact in marine ecosystems because empirical data are lacking; however, this introduces uncertainty into the results. As part of a spatial cumulative impact assessment for Spencer Gulf, South Australia, we asked experts to estimate score ranges (best-case, most-likely and worst-case), which accounted for their uncertainty about the effect of 32 threats on eight ecosystems. Expert scores were combined with data on the spatial pattern and intensity of threats to generate cumulative impact maps based on each of the three scoring scenarios, as well as simulations and maps of uncertainty. We compared our method, which explicitly accounts for the experts' knowledge-based uncertainty, with other approaches and found that it provides smaller uncertainty bounds, leading to more constrained assessment results. Collecting these additional data on experts' knowledge-based uncertainty provides transparency and simplifies interpretation of the outputs from spatial cumulative impact assessments, facilitating their application for sustainable resource management and conservation.},

  abstract = {Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is a promising approach to guide marine spatial planning (MSP) and management. One limitation of CIA is the neglect of seascape connectivity, which may spread the impact of localized pressures to ambient areas, e.g. through lost dispersal and recruitment of organisms. We here, for the first time, incorporate seascape connectivity into a traditional CIA model using a connectivity matrix, exemplified by dispersal of propagules estimated through biophysical modelling. Two connectivity impacts are identified: the source impact represents downstream areas losing recruits because of reduced larval dispersal from sites affected by the pressure, and the sink impact represents loss of recruits originating from upstream areas prevented from settlement in the site affected by the local pressure. By including seascape connectivity in the Swedish MSP-guiding CIA tool Symphony we demonstrate how to practically account for remote effects of local environmental impact. Our example on blue mussel shows how reducing mussel fitness in a given area may have impacts on mussels far from the acting pressures. Overall, results indicate that connectivity impact for blue mussels plays a minor role in most areas, ¡10\% of the ordinary cumulative impact. However, in some smaller areas, e.g. on offshore banks and the Danish Straits, seascape connectivity may increase ordinary cumulative impact with 20\%-30\%. In an example of scenario-based CIA analyses of MSP projections, we demonstrate how impacts of particular management actions, e.g. shipping rerouting and wind power developments, can be tracked far from the original area of influence. Depending on the dispersal ability of ecosystem components, a local pressure may impact a considerable area through seascape connectivity, transgressing management units and national borders. Although the mean connectivity impact may be modest for a single ecosystem component, the consideration of seascape connectivity across multiple ecosystem components may significantly alter the mapping of cumulative impact and the assessment of different MSP scenarios. Synthesis and applications. Our extension of Cumulative Impact Assessment offers a new method for mapping and practically integrating seascape connectivity with ecosystem-based MSP and other spatial instruments for policy making, such as marine protected areas.},

  abstract = {The term “cumulative effects assessment” is frequently used yet the underlying principles and definitions are poorly specified. Consequently, there is no consistency or standardisation in approaches leaving marine managers and developers perplexed on how best to discharge their legal obligations to undertake cumulative effects assessment. This paper explores some of the origins of the terminology and re-interprets how these may best be applied to standardise the vocabulary and approaches to cumulative effects assessment. We define cumulative effects assessment as a systematic procedure for identifying and evaluating the significance of effects from multiple sources/activities and for providing an estimate on the overall expected impact to inform management measures. The analysis of the causes (source of pressures and effects), pathways and consequences of these effects on receptors is an essential and integral part of the process. Environmental risk assessment concepts, in particular sound problem formulation, have been used to provide a clear structure for cumulative effects assessment. We recommend that risk screening, prioritisation and evaluation should be a critical component of cumulative effects assessment to facilitate a filtering of the complex issues for consideration of the likelihood of exposure of receptors to pressures and the likelihood of a receptor responding to those pressures. This paper is intended to provide practical assistance to marine environmental impact assessment practitioners, marine environmental regulators and policy makers.

The workshop organizers chose cardiovascular disease (CVD) as an example health outcome for which cumulative risk considerations could illuminate environmental and health management strategies. To guide discussions, we developed a series of conceptual models illustrating factors influencing CVD. The CVD conceptual model represents complex processes across varying space and time scales, different causal pathways, and multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors and factors. It includes causal influences of environmental exposures and lifestyle choices, in the context of genetics and medical factors. The representation of cumulative risk as a network of interrelated nodes and arrows helps define and organize the problem and available information, determine the scope and scale, and creates a platform for analysis. It provides an interface for discussing how different entities (e.g., environmental versus health-driven organizations) can work together on different parts of the problem, and facilitates relative risk ranking and management triage. Color coding is used to distinguish categories of stressors and possible oversight responsibility. This work informs guidelines for CRA planning and assessment of factor combinations affecting real-world risk.},

  abstract = {Like most ocean regions today, the European and contiguous seas experience cumulative impacts from local human activities and global pressures. They are largely in poor environmental condition with deteriorating trends. Despite several success stories, European policies for marine conservation fall short of being effective. Acknowledging the challenges for marine conservation, a 4-year multi-national network, MarCons, supported collaborative marine conservation efforts to bridge the gap between science, management and policy, aiming to contribute in reversing present negative trends. By consolidating a large network of more than 100 scientists from 26 countries, and conducting a series of workshops over 4 years (2016-2020), MarCons analyzed challenges, opportunities and obstacles for advancing marine conservation in the European and contiguous seas. Here, we synthesize the major issues that emerged from this analysis and make 12 key recommendations for policy makers, marine managers, and researchers. To increase the effectiveness of marine conservation planning, we recommend (1) designing coherent networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the framework of marine spatial planning (MSP) and applying systematic conservation planning principles, including re-evaluation of existing management zones, (2) designing MPA networks within a broader transboundary planning framework, and (3) implementing integrated land-freshwater-sea approaches. To address inadequate or poorly informed management, we recommend (4) developing and implementing adaptive management plans in all sites of the Natura 2000 European conservation network and revising the Natura 2000 framework, (5) embedding and implementing cumulative effects assessments into a risk management process and making them operational, and (6) promoting actions to reach `good environmental status' in all European waters. To account for global change in conservation planning and management, we further recommend (7) developing conservation strategies to address the impacts of global change, for example identifying climate-change refugia as high priority conservation areas, and (8) incorporating biological invasions in conservation plans and prioritizing management actions to control invasive species. Finally, to improve current practices that may compromise the effectiveness of conservation actions, we recommend (9) reinforcing the collection of high-quality open-access data, (10) improving mechanisms for public participation in MPA planning and management, (11) prioritizing conservation goals in full collaboration with stakeholders, and (12) addressing gender inequality in marine sciences and conservation.},

Crucial to successful implementation of these initiatives is a comprehensive understanding of the current ecological condition of landscapes and their spatial distributions. Here, we provide a cumulative measure of human modification of terrestrial lands based on modeling the physical extents of 13 anthropogenic stressors and their estimated impacts using spatially explicit global datasets with a median year of 2016. We quantified the degree of land modification and the amount and spatial configuration of low modified lands (i.e., natural areas relatively free from human alteration) across all ecoregions and biomes. We identified that fewer unmodified lands remain than previously reported and that most of the world is in a state of intermediate modification, with 52\% of ecoregions classified as moderately modified. Given that these moderately modified ecoregions fall within critical land use thresholds, we propose that they warrant elevated attention and require proactive spatial planning to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function before important environmental values are lost.},

How environmental science responds to the many new challenges of the Anthropocene is at the forefront of the field. The aim of this perspective is to describe Anthropocene as a concept and a time period and discuss its relevance to the contemporary study of environmental science. Specifically, we consider areas in environmental science which may need to be revisited to adjust to complexity of the new era: (a) recalibrate the idea of environmental baselines as Anthropogenic baselines; (b) rethink multiple stressor approaches to recognize a system under flux; (c) re-evaluate the relationship of environmental science with other disciplines, particularly Earth Systems Science, but also social sciences and humanities. The all-encompassing nature of the Anthropocene necessitates the need to revise and reorganize to meet the challenge of complexity.},

  abstract = {In the present research work, a comprehensive tool for cumulative ecotoxicological impact assessment of ionic liquids (ILs) to aquatic life has been constructed. Using the probabilistic tool, impact of individual ILs to a group of aquatic species is assessed by chemical toxicity distributions (CTDs). The impact of group of ILs to individual aquatic species is assessed by species sensitivity distributions (SSDs). Acute toxicity data of imidazolium ILs with chloride (Cl- ), bromide (Br- ), tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) anions are used in CTD and SSD. Allowable concentrations for a group of Imidazolium ILs with the same mode of action (SMOA) to five aquatic species; Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri, Algae, Zebrafish, and Escherichia coli are estimated by CTDs. It has been concluded that 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) possess the lowest risk at an acceptable risk value of 750 x 10-5 mmol/L which is 12\% less than that of OMIMCl. Furthermore, the sensitivities towards the aquatic species reveal that from the studied ILs, BMIMBF4 with an acceptable risk value of 3200 x 10-5 mmol/L is the most suitable IL towards the selected aquatic species. Hence, current work provides cumulative allowable concentrations and acceptable risk values for ILs which release to aquatic compartment of ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Multiple planned dams in developing countries, mostly for hydropower, are threatening some of the world's great river systems. Concern over their social and environmental impacts has led to hydropower being excluded from the sustainability term `green energy.' Better planning, design and operation of hydropower dams could guide where to build and not to build, and how to mitigate some of their negative impacts. Impact assessments presently done for dams include Cumulative Impact Assessments (CIAs) or similar at the basin level, and Environmental Impact Assessments at the project level. These typically do not detail how the river ecosystem could change and the implications for its dependent social structures. A comprehensive Environmental Flows (EFlows) Assessment does provide this information but is almost always not linked to the other impact assessments. When done at all, it is often rudimentary; rarely basin-wide; and almost always done after major development decisions have already been made. A more effective approach for any basin targeted for hydropower or other large dam development would be to formally and automatically embed the requirement for a basin-wide, detailed EFlows Assessment into a CIA. This should be done at the earliest stage of planning, before dam sites are selected and allocated to developers. The EFlows method adopted matters, as it dictates the scope and flexibility of a study. Rapid one-size-fits-all methods do not provide the detail that governments and other stakeholders need to understand the possible future of their river basins, negotiate and make informed decisions.},

  abstract = {The Arctic Region is characterised by vulnerable ecosystems and residing indigenous people, dependent on nature for subsistence fishing and hunting. The Arctic also contains a wealth of non-living natural resources such as minerals and hydrocarbons. Synergies between increased access and growing global demand for the Arctic resources influence the level and nature of human activity and its influence on the environment. It is therefore essential to assess and mitigate the cumulative impacts from these activities. Environmental Assessment (EA) is a common tool applied by the Arctic nations to secure that environmental considerations are included in decision-making when new plans and projects are implemented. However, recent research has indicated that assessment of cumulative impacts in EAs is inconsistent and the practises ambiguous. This article explores this phenomenon further by reviewing and analysing current practices of assessing cumulative impacts in EAs in relation to offshore oil and gas activities in the Arctic. It is found that cumulative impacts assessments are generally lacking. The practitioners involved explain this with reference to the challenge of addressing and assessing cumulative impacts due to their complex nature. They further point at lacking methodological guidelines as well as lack of resources during the impact assessment process.},

While the MSPD is ambiguous on how to approach the assessment of collective pressures, the present study is based on a preunderstanding that CIAs are required in marine spatial planning (MSP) for two reasons. Firstly, to address all relevant human activities and their pressures in order to comply with the concept of an `ecosystem-based approach' and to ensure a good environmental status. Secondly, indirectly, to ensure that land-sea interactions are taken into account. Our results show few and inadequate examples of CIA in national MSP processes. Most MSP processes address collective pressure through CIA as part of a strategic environmental impact assessment. In conclusion, while the MSPD requires MSP to ensure collective pressure is kept below a level compatible with good environmental status, as part of an ecosystem-based approach, the study found few examples of ecosystembased MSP.},

  abstract = {Traditional land use systems are threatened by land use intensification and resulting land cover transitions in northern areas. This article examines cumulative land cover changes and their impacts on reindeer grazing grounds in the Kyro reindeer herding district in northern Finland. Land cover transitions were studied using Landsat TM and OLI images and topographic maps. The results showed that the herding district has experienced notable land cover changes during the past decades, and most of these changes were directly related to forestry. The proportion of continuous coniferous forests of the total forest cover declined from 92\% to 78\% between 1987 and 2013. Approximately one third of the forests outside current conservation areas were disturbed by forest management by 2013, and remaining forests were notably more fragmented than forests within conservation areas. The extent of the road and path networks expanded considerably between 1960s and 2010 as a result of increasing logging and tourism. Accumulation of disturbances gradually results in loss of key resources and declined quality of the landscape mosaic from the reindeer herding perspective, which can pose a serious threat to long-term sustainability of the livelihood. Rapid land cover changes in non-protected areas highlight an increasingly important role of conservation areas in maintaining resources for reindeer husbandry in the face of intensifying land use. Sustainable management of resources outside conservation areas requires careful participatory planning and efficient cumulative impact assessment of different land use activities.

In Europe, recent developments in mapping of marine habitats and human activities now enable a coherent spatial evaluation of potential combined effects of human activities. Results indicate that combined effects from multiple human pressures are spread to 96\% of the European marine area, and more specifically that combined effects from physical disturbance are spread to 86\% of the coastal area and 46\% of the shelf area. We compare our approach with corresponding assessments at other spatial scales and validate our results with European-scale status assessments for coastal waters. Uncertainties and development points are identified. Still, the results suggest that Europe's seas are widely disturbed, indicating potential discrepancy between ambitions for Blue Growth and the objective of achieving good environmental status within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

The research is set in the Lower Fraser River Basin, a densely populated sub-watershed in British Columbia's lower mainland. Eight requirements or requisites for the watershed cumulative effects assessment and management are applied to evaluate current capacity for implementation in the Lower Fraser, and to identify the areas in need of capacity development. Results show that advancing watershed cumulative effects assessment and management requires not only good science but also leadership in the coordination of monitoring programs, and in ensuring the appropriate incentives and penalties for engagement and nonengagement. The lack of leadership in this regard is the result of existing governance structures arranged around the political boundaries, which have produced over time multiple agencies and jurisdictional fragmentation. Notwithstanding this, we argue that the watershed is the most appropriate scale for assessing and managing the cumulative effects to complex ecosystems.},

In this paper, we draw on critical theories on dialogue and collaboration to present a novel approach to joint problem analysis between Sami reindeer herders and civil servants in Swedish permitting authorities on mining, wind energy and forestry. We discuss process design choices, insights on CEA governance and ways to tackle these barriers in practice. We argue that indigenous-state collaboration may play a constructive role in improving CEA governance, including the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights. However, this requires a process that carves out new spaces for exploring divergent problem definitions and supports the participants in challenging institutionalized inequalities within their positioned realities.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) remains an Achilles heel in the licensing of mining projects on indigenous lands globally, but especially in the European North. Yet, rather than legislating on indigenous rights and CEA failures, governments tend to rely on companies to mitigate cumulative impacts through new corporate social responsibility actions. This paper considers if these voluntary actions improve companies’ CEA performance and so provide grounds for indigenous communities and decision makers to trust the industry more. Findings are presented from a systematic review of corporate impact assessments for 56 mining concession permit applications on Sami lands in Sweden. We show how companies that adopt additional voluntary measures provide somewhat richer assessments. Overall, however, the performance remains poor also for ‘frontrunners’, with persistent lack of clarity on methods and limited analysis of consequences, social and cultural impacts and interactions with other (past, present or future) projects. We conclude that progress in voluntary actions in regard to assessing cumulative impacts has only led to cosmetic improvements in CEA performance. We therefore argue for stronger regulatory role of government and recognition of the right of indigenous communities to lead or co-manage impact assessments on their own lands.},

  abstract = {When Indigenous rights and demands for mineral wealth collide, knowledge of mining impacts is a highly contested area. Yet the scholarly literature contains few studies of the impacts borne by Indigenous groups. In this paper, we offer an empirical analysis of mining impacts on Sami reindeer herding in two cases from Sweden. The mine in Kaunisvaara is an active, open-pit iron mine operated by Kaunis Iron. The mine in Stihke was an underground copper/zinc mine operated from 1976 to 1988 by Boliden. Data generation comprised of interviews, workshops, field visits, participatory GIS, and literature review. The findings show how the two mines have caused similar impacts, including on the land and the reindeer, the economy, and Sami culture, health, and well-being. In a comparative analysis we discuss five themes: i) discrepancies between anticipated and actual impacts, ii) mismatches between impacts and compensation, iii) flaws in Swedish mining regulations - specifically for impact assessment, iv) who holds relevant knowledge to predict impacts, and v) patterns of dispossession rather than co-existence. We argue that if governments and mining companies were to genuinely consider the full scale of impacts, then it would entail a fundamental paradigm shift in mining governance in Sweden.},

  abstract = {The cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on water systems are of rapidly growing concern within the field of environmental sciences and management, Most studies have focused on mixture toxicity and have dealt with responses of biota at either organismal or population level. Few studies have addressed responses of organisms exposed to combinations of chemical and physical stressors. Although antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects have been described for exposure of biota to combinations of chemical stressors, it seems to be agreed that concentration addition proves to be a reasonable worst case estimation. Therefore, aggregation of physico-chemical parameters in water quality indices and supplementary specifications of environmental quality objectives to account for mixture toxicity are generally based on concentration addition. In spite of a growing interest in multiple stressors, basic data are often lacking or inadequate to allow precise predictions of the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors at the ecosystem level. Even in the long term, investigation of all probable ecotoxicological responses to exposure to all possible combinations of stressors does not seem practically or economically feasible. Monitoring of a sophisticated combination of physico-chemical, and biological parameters improves detection and ecotoxicological risk assessment of multiple stressors. Application of quantitative structure-activity relationships, algorithms for mixture toxicity of known substances, (bio)chemical group parameters and response-oriented sum parameters may reduce uncertainties of cumulative impact assessment and can improve water quality management.},

  abstract = {Over the last five decades, the Athabasca River Basin in Alberta, Canada, has been subjected to a wide range of environmental stressors from diverse human developments. This has resulted in an escalation of government, academic, industry and community-based monitoring and research efforts. However, despite all the attention received, a comprehensive synthesis of what has been studied is lacking, in particular, in relation to the efforts examining single versus multiple stressors. Based on a systematic literature review, we found 386 publications from 1969 to 2018 on the Athabasca River focusing on single stressors (68.4\%) compared to multiple stressors (31.6\%). There was a significant shift in the focus of studies between the 1990s and present from assessing threats of pulp and paper developments to those related to oil sands activities, with studies most predominantly addressing chemical stressors. Despite these efforts, there remain significant knowledge gaps regarding the cumulative effects of multiple stressors, particularly on biological and ecological endpoints. Correspondingly, a wide range of contradictory conclusions were reported regarding the ecological, regulatory and societal significance of the reported environmental impacts, highlighting both the complexity and often lack of standardization of approaches used. This emphasizes the need for improved integration of monitoring and research activities that are hypothesis driven, have clear objectives, and are better aligned with environmental management processes and decisions.

  abstract = {Multiple stressors resulting from anthropogenic actions are increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. In general, ecosystems change as they respond to multiple threats that interact in complex ways, depending on the natural environment. This scenario poses complex tasks for researchers, managers, and policymakers, which require a well-defined framework to provide a clear roadmap that identify steps to apply in adaptive management decisions, monitoring designs and policy implementation. Building upon core elements of previous work, we present a Multiple Stressors Assessment Framework (MSAF) for aquatic ecosystems that provides a roadmap on the achievement of an improved integration between monitoring designs, data acquisition, evaluation processes, and management actions. The MSAF involves seven steps: 1) problem formulation and the definition of the ecosystem type and the spatial-temporal scale, 2) data compilation on the ecosystems' environmental characteristics and the definition of the type, identity and intensity of environmental stressors, 3) data compilation/collection on the biological/ecological receptors (endpoints) to stressors and selection of response variable to monitor (based on structure-based indicators and functional metrics), 4) characterization of the stressor-response relationships and their interactions, 5) construction of specific ecological conceptual models and choice of adequate statistical approaches to test the conceptual models' viability, 6) generation of hypotheses on interactive effects on biological/ecological endpoints, validation of models, hypotheses testing and, if possible, comparison of results with controlled experiments in realistic settings, and 7) recommendations to adaptive monitoring and if necessary, improvement of the study design, and eventual inclusion of other hypotheses and statistical approaches in the context of adaptive management actions. We review progress made in Europe, the USA and Canada in this field using case examples, highlight the approaches taken by the different jurisdictions that align with our framework and identify the linkages between multiple stressors assessments and decision-making for each region. We conclude that a disconnection remains between the investigation of the combined effects of multiple stressors and the implementation of management practices and policy translation. The way forward is through a collaborative effort to create standardized methodologies and appropriate programmes in this field. We hope the proposed framework can be used as a foundation to diagnose multiple stressor interactions and identify responses of ecological indicators to inform effective adaptive management of freshwater ecosystems globally.},

  abstract = {Incorporating ecosystem changes from non-indigenous species (NIS) is an important task of maritime spatial planning. Maritime spatial planning requires a framework that emphasises ecological functioning in a state of dynamic change, including changes to ecosystem services from functions introduced by new NIS. Adaptable modelling toolsets should be developed that can readily incorporate knowledge of new NIS. In the Baltic Sea, recent NIS examples are the North American mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii and the Ponto-Caspian round goby Neogobius melanostomus. We performed environmental niche modelling that predicted N. melanostomus will spread across large areas of the Baltic Sea coast while R. harrisii will be limited to regions with high temperature and low salinity conditions. We then performed a meta-analysis on literature showing effects in the Baltic Sea from these NIS and calculated the standardised effect-sizes on relevant ecosystem services. Half the impacts identified for N. melanostomus were considered to increase ecosystem service outcomes, while all R. harrisii impacts caused apparent decreases. Effect coefficients were incorporated into an online impact assessment tool developed by the Estonian Marine Institute. Users with or without science training can use the portal to estimate areas impacted and changes to natural assets (km(2)) caused by these NIS and cumulative effects from other pressure-types. Impact estimates are based on best available knowledge from manipulative and correlative experiments and thus form a link between science and management. Dynamic modelling techniques informed from varied ecological and methodological perspectives will effectively advise spatial planners about rapid maritime changes and mitigation actions to reduce NIS impacts especially in the focus areas.

  abstract = {Development pressures have grown dramatically in the Northwest Territories (NWT) over the past decade and are likely to continue to increase over the coming years. Proper assessment and management of the cumulative effects of these developments poses significant challenges and, if done properly, offer real opportunities for responsible economic development within a sound environmental management framework. While no one agency has sole responsible for assessing and managing cumulative effects, it is clear that no agency is without responsibility. For this reason, a partnership of representatives from aboriginal, territorial, and federal governments; environmental nongovernment organizations; the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board; and the mining and oil and gas sectors developed an innovative framework for the NWT to address these challenges. The components of the integrated framework include an overall vision and objectives, land use planning, baseline studies and monitoring, research, audit and reporting, project-specific screening, environmental assessment and review, regulation and enforcement, information management, coordination, and capacity building. Implementation of the framework will better enable decision makers to make the wise decisions necessary to protect the natural and social environment of the NWT and, at the same time, promote responsible development.},

  abstract = {Although an ecosystem approach to fisheries has been recognized as a means of progressing toward sustainable fishing, successful implementation of this approach has been limited. However, one way in which progress has been made is through the use of suites of indicators. Decision tree frameworks can be used to incorporate trends in ecological, fishing, and environmental indicators into ecosystem assessments. A relatively generic decision tree framework has been developed and successfully applied to multiple ecosystems. This framework incorporates trends in indicators, as well as the impacts of fishing pressure and environmental variability on ecological indicators in order to assess the state of each ecosystem. The inclusion of ecosystem expert knowledge from the outset ensures trends are correctly interpreted and allows analyses to contribute to global comparisons in a robust and meaningful manner. Although ecological and environmental indicators are well developed, those addressing the human dimensions of marine ecosystems are less so. This framework holds the potential to incorporate such indicators in order to fully assess marine ecosystems in a comparative context. Such assessments could help ensure food security from marine resources into the future as well as ensuring the well-being of coastal communities. Here critical review of the potential value of this framework has been conducted, with its usefulness emphasized in the similarities it holds, and in the contribution it could make, to current global methods of ecosystem assessments.},

  abstract = {Cumulative impact assessments can inform ecosystem-based management by mapping human pressures and assessing their intensity on ecosystem components. However, its use to inform local management is scarce, largely due to the need for fine-grained spatial data representing ecosystem threats that can assess impacts at a local scale. Here, we applied the cumulative impact assessment framework to Moorea's coral reef, French Polynesia to inform the ongoing revision of the island-wide marine spatial management plan. We combined high spatial resolution data on 11 local anthropogenic pressures and four ecological components with expert vulnerability assessments. Results revealed that the entire reef is impacted by at least four pressures: coral reef fisheries, agriculture, land use change and urbanization. These activities together contribute to 87\% of the overall cumulative impact. Most importantly, land-based activities contribute to more than half (52\%) of the overall impact. Other high-impact activities, such as reef-based tourism, remain very localized and contribute little to the overall human impact. These findings show that by focusing solely on reef-based activities, the current management plan misses critical sources of impact. Not considering land-based activities in the management may lead to decisions that could fail to significantly lower cumulative human impact on the reef. This study demonstrates how operationalizing the cumulative human impact framework at a local scale can help managers identify key leverage points likely to yield improved ecological outcomes.

New tools to analyse. characterise and quantify the combined risks to health or the environment from multiple stressors are presented or reviewed. Examples of cumulative stressors are mixtures of chemicals alone or in combination with biological or physical environmental factors such as pathogens and climate extremes. Among the main findings, the scientific work points at the importance of time in dealing with toxicity, and in particular the toxicity of chemical mixtures, the natures of the uncertainties associated with risk assessment and the value of visualisation in identifying and quantifying the most relevant risks. A major conclusion of the project is that researchers and regulators should focus on the receptor rather than on the single stressor or combination of agents. There is also a need for more efforts on mechanistic understanding and for a mechanism-based framework for interpreting mixture/multiple stressor effects. The new tools are available on the internet (http://nomiracle.jrc.ec.europa.eu). (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The assessment of the cumulative impacts of multiple human activities is an increasingly important yet complex part of managing the marine environment. Despite this, as yet, there is no consistent approach to considering these in assessments and/or management (e.g. environmental impact assessment, marine spatial planning). Current and previous approaches to the assessment of cumulative impacts have limitations and shortcomings e.g. double counting of impacts or avoiding, complicating and confounding impacts, which need to be addressed to allow for pragmatic decisions to be made. Here, an innovative, practical approach to marine CIA is presented that considers the three dimensional nature of the marine environment, and the spatial and temporal effects-footprints likely to occur during the lifetime of a development. The new approach is tested within a GIS platform and shows an effective visual representation for decision makers, managers and policy makers on which to base their decisions. While showing potential, the approach indicates the need to incorporate temporal data and assessing temporal trends. Despite this limitation, the tool markedly improves on previous approaches due to the national and practical application, and the incorporation of 3D nature of pressures and receptors.},

  abstract = {Social impacts resulting from policy changes and other interventions interact and aggregate, and are influenced by additional interventions and exogenous factors, leading to cumulative social impacts. We explored these complex impacts through a case study of forest policy changes introduced in the state of Western Australia between 1999 and 2004. In this process, we both drew on and modified the recently-proposed Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management (CEAM) framework, to improve its utility as an analytical tool for exploring cumulative social impacts that arise from policy changes in natural resource sectors. Our findings highlight the complexity of the pathways that lead to social impacts and the significant influence of individuals' responses. The findings also demonstrate the importance of considering cumulative impacts - negative and positive, and intended and unintended - when designing and implementing mitigation strategies, emphasizing the value of adaptive management approaches. Our results suggest that the CEAM framework, appropriately contextualized and adapted, is relevant to the assessment of social impacts associated with interventions in complex natural resource management cases, and probably more widely.},

  abstract = {Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is the process of systematically assessing a proposed action's cumulative environmental effects in the context of past, present, and future actions, regardless of who undertakes such actions. Previous studies have examined CIA efforts at the federal level but little is known about how states assess the cumulative impacts of nonfederal projects. By examining state environmental review statutes, administrative rules, agency-prepared materials, and a national survey of the administrators of state environmental review programs, this study identifies the legal and administrative frameworks for CIA. It examines current CIA practice, discusses the relationship between CIA policy and its implementation, and explores the opportunities for improvement. The results of the study show that twenty-nine state environmental review programs across twenty-six states required the assessment of cumulative environmental impacts. More than half of these programs have adopted specific procedures for implementing their policies. Some programs assessed cumulative impacts using a standard review document, and others have created their own documentations incorporated into applications for state permits or funding. The majority of programs have adopted various scales, baselines, significance criteria, and coordination practices in their CIA processes. Mixed methods were generally used for data collection and analysis; qualitative methods were more prevalent than quantitative methods. The results also suggest that a program with comprehensive and consistent environmental review policies and procedures does not always imply extensive CIA requirements and practices. Finally, this study discusses the potential for improving existing CIA processes and promoting CIA efforts in states without established environmental review programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, some projects focus on a single impact on hydrodynamic conditions, water quality or marine organisms. In a case study in Xiamen, China, an integrated effects assessment framework centres on ecohydrology, using modeling of hydrodynamic conditions and statistical analysis of water quality, was developed to assess the effects of ecological restoration projects. The benefits of SDADO projects include improving hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, as a precursor to further marine biological improvements. This study highlights the need to comprehensively consider ecological effects of SDADO projects in the planning stage, and an integrative assessment method combining cumulative effects of hydrodynamic conditions, water quality and biological factors.

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) should be conducted at ecologically meaningful scales such as large marine ecosystems to halt further ocean degradation caused by anthropogenic pressures and facilitate ecosystem-based management such as transboundary marine spatial planning (MSP). However, few studies exist at large marine ecosystems scale, especially in the West Pacific seas, where countries have different MSP processes yet transboundary cooperation is paramount. Thus, a step-wise CEA would be informative to help bordering countries set a common goal. Building on the risk-based CEA framework, we decomposed CEA into risk identification and spatially-explicit risk analysis and applied it to the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (YSLME), aiming to understand the most influential cause-effect pathways and risk distribution pattern. The results showed that (1) seven human activities including port, mariculture, fishing, industry and urban development, shipping, energy, and coastal defence, and three pressures including physical loss of seabed, input of hazardous substances, nitrogen, and phosphorus enrichment were the leading causes of environmental problems in the YSLME; (2) benthic organisms, fishes, algae, tidal flats, seabirds, and marine mammals were the most vulnerable ecosystem components on which cumulative effects acted; (3) areas with relatively high risk mainly concentrated on nearshore zones, especially Shandong, Liaoning, and northern Jiangsu, while coastal bays of South Korea also witnessed high risk; (4) certain risks could be observed in the transboundary area, of which the causes were the pervasive fishing, shipping, and sinking of pollutants in this area due to the cyclonic circulation and fine-grained sediments. In future transboundary cooperation on MSP, risk criteria and evaluation of existing management measures should be incorporated to determine whether the identified risk has exceeded the acceptable level and identify the next step of cooperation. Our study presents an example of CEA at large marine ecosystems scale and provides a reference to other large marine ecosystems in the West Pacific and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {From the time it appeared in the 1978 regulations implementing the United States' National Environmental Policy Act, agencies have struggled with the concept of cumulative impacts in their environmental analyses. Although the regulations touch on every aspect of environmental impact analysis, they merely define cumulative impacts and then refer to them only in other definitions in the Terminology section. Agencies have become fairly adept at analyzing direct and indirect effects, but cumulative impacts have posed more difficult methodological problems, giving rise to a host of legal challenges. The courts have attempted to sort out what is required for adequate cumulative impact analysis, causing agencies to reactively develop agencys-pecific, and often complex, methodologies. This article relates the basic concepts of cumulative impact assessment to emerging case law, focusing on US federal land management issues. From this basis, it proposes a novel approach to cumulative effects analysis that (1) uses the doctrine of proximate cause from tort law to ensure that there is a reasonable probability that a proposal will affect a resource of concern before undertaking analysis of other effects on that resource, and (2) uses the No Action Alternative's trajectory of resource conditions (which incorporates the effects of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions) as the baseline for assessing an action's incremental effects. The proposed six-step process integrates effects analysis by describing the overall effects of the No Action Alternative, altered by an action's direct and indirect (or incremental) effects, as the cumulative effect on a particular resource of concern.},

  abstract = {Effective management of coral reefs requires strategies tailored to cope with cumulative disturbances from human activities. In Brazil, where coral reefs are a priority for conservation, intensifying threats from local and global stressors are of paramount concern to management agencies. Using a cumulative impact assessment approach, our goal was to inform management actions for coral reefs in Brazil by assessing their exposure to multiple stressors (fishing, land-based activities, coastal development, mining, aquaculture, shipping, and global warming). We calculated an index of the risk to cumulative impacts: (i) assuming uniform sensitivity of coral reefs to stressors; and (ii) using impact weights to reflect varying tolerance levels of coral reefs to each stressor. We also predicted the index in both the presence and absence of global warming. We found that 16\% and 37\% of coral reefs had high to very high risk of cumulative impacts, without and with information on sensitivity respectively, and 42\% of reefs had low risk to cumulative impacts from both local and global stressors. Our outputs are the first comprehensive spatial dataset of cumulative impact on coral reefs in Brazil, and show that areas requiring attention mostly corresponded to those closer to population centres. We demonstrate how the relationships between risks from local and global stressors can be used to derive strategic management actions.},

Location Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Brazil, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Methods We developed a prioritization approach to protecting different habitat types, threatened species ranges and ecological connectivity, while also mitigating the impacts of multiple threats on biodiversity. When identifying priorities for conservation, we accounted for the co-occurrence of 24 human threats and the distribution of 161 marine habitats and 143 threatened species, as well as their associated vulnerabilities. Additionally, we compared our conservation priorities with MPAs proposed by local stakeholders. Results We show that impacts to habitats and species are widespread and identify hot spots of cumulative impacts on inshore and offshore areas. Industrial fisheries, climate change and land-based activities were the most severe threats to biodiversity. The highest priorities were mostly found towards the coast due to the high cumulative impacts found in nearshore areas. As expected, our systematic approach showed a better performance on selecting priority sites when compared to the MPAs proposed by local stakeholders without a typical conservation planning exercise, increasing the existing coverage of MPAs by only 7.9\%. However, we found that proposed MPAs still provide some opportunities to protect areas facing high levels of threats. Main conclusions The study presents a blueprint of how to embrace a comprehensive ecological approach when identifying strategic priorities for conservation. We advocate protecting these crucial areas from degradation in emerging conservation efforts is key to maintain their biodiversity value.},

  abstract = {Remnants of vegetation, to some extent, a result of human development, have vastly been altered and decreased in quality and quantity over the past decades in Australia. In order to rehabilitate these vitally important parts of ecosystems with the usually limited budget and logistical facilities, a sound scientific prioritization scheme is required. In this study in the Boorowa region to the north west of Canberra, Australia, we used the cumulative effects assessment approach to provide such prioritization scheme. We detected the change in quantity of remnant vegetation that had happened during the years 1973 - 2000 using Landsat MSS and TM Images. We projected the change in quantity over the years 2000 - 2027 using a combination of cellular automata and neural network methods. We then used neural network and ground truth to model the structural complexity of the remnants as a measure of quality and linked that to the estimated change in quantity in the past and projected change in the future. Combining the assessed change in quantity and modelled change in quality of vegetation for the past and future provided a basis for prioritization of remnant vegetation for rehabilitation measures.},

  abstract = {Stressors created by multiple resource industries can result in cumulative effects over time and space. Many studies have evaluated single stressors and assumed that cumulative effects can be understood by adding stressors together. However, there is growing evidence that interactive effects are important in structuring biological communities. We evaluated whether the effects of multiple stressors in the boreal forest (linear features, energy, forestry) combine additively or interactively by testing a candidate model set of 12 cumulative effects models of abundance for 27 landbird species. We fitted paired additive and interactive Generalized Additive Models and examined model predictions in the Athabasca Oil Sands Area of Alberta, Canada, and a theoretical no-disturbance version of the study area. Of the 27 species examined, an additive disturbance model was the best for nine species, while an interactive disturbance model was the best for 11 species. In the current study area, disturbance models predicted strong increases in abundance for species associated with deciduous forest and open habitats (winning species) and moderate decreases for species associated with conifer forest (losing species). We found a 15\% change in landbird community composition between the current study area, with 8.4\% disturbance, and the theoretical no-disturbance study area. Complex synergistic and antagonistic interactions among stressors were observed for 39\% of landbird species, with the majority of interactions observed being synergistic. Stressors with relatively small disturbance areas, such as narrow linear disturbances, frequently interacted with other stressors to affect species' responses, and energy sector stressors often had additive or interactive effects with forestry stressors. Interactive cumulative effects from multiple sectors will make it increasingly difficult for industry and land managers to manage impacts unless interactions among stressors are incorporated into cumulative effects assessments and regional land use planning processes.},

  abstract = {Landscapes in Canada are undergoing change due to resource and land use stressors and climate stressors. Understanding the cumulative effects of these stressors is challenging because of the complexity of ecosystems, the variability of stressors, and species response to individual or multiple stressors. A key challenge within the field of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is guidance that describes and evaluates analytical methods. In this review we discuss four broad categories of methods with current or potential use for project-based and effects-based CEA for species in terrestrial systems: (i) qualitative review, (ii) habitat supply models, (iii) empirical species–stressor models, and (iv) decision support models. We describe each method and provide examples, highlight advantages and limitations, identify how methods address key science-based CEA questions, and provide direction on when and why to use specific CEA methods. Empirical species–stressor models and decision support models are the only analytical approaches that provide answers to many science-based CEA questions including how multiple stressors combine to affect an individual species and the certainty of multiple stressor effects. We provide recommendations for using one or more methods as complementary building blocks to fill data gaps, improve understanding and communication, engage diverse partner groups, and increase the quality and credibility of the CEA. Our review supports a move toward regional scale, effects-based CEA where partner collaboration to design, implement, and analyze comprehensive assessments of multiple stressors will (i) expand our knowledge of terrestrial species response to stressors and (ii) inform best management practices for resource industries and conservation and management actions for land managers.},

  abstract = {Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins have historically inhabited the northern waters off Lantau Island, Hong Kong; however their numbers have significantly decreased over the past decade, while human pressure has simultaneously increased. Based on a spatio-temporal analysis using a Geographic Information System (GIS), this study aims to assess the cumulative human impacts of local activities on this dolphin population since 1996. After introducing and discussing the multiple approaches, difficulties, and limitations to cumulative effects assessments (CEA), this paper outlines our proposed CEA methodology. Our methodology involves mapping and analysis of anthropogenic marine impacts in relation with historical dolphin distributions in the area. Local scale results show evidence of a relationship between the addition of new high-speed ferry (HSF) routes into the cumulative environment and the decrease in dolphins in a specific region known as the Brothers Islands. These results coincide with past research showing that whales and dolphins are significantly disrupted in the presence of high vessel traffic, which continues to grow in the northern waters off Lantau Island, Hong Kong and in many other places around the world.

  abstract = {The expansion and intensification of marine uses have severe cumulative impacts on marine ecosystems and human well-being, unless they are properly managed with an ecosystem-based management approach. A systematic conservation planning approach, using marxan with zones, was applied to generate alternative marine spatial plans for the Aegean Sea. Relevant human uses were included and their cumulative impact on a wide set of key biodiversity features was considered in the analysis. Different cost scenarios were developed to gain insight on the effects of the approaches used to assess socio-economic factors, and their potential impact on spatial plans. The spatial plans generated differed greatly depending on the method used to estimate opportunity costs and evaluate human activities in monetary terms. The vulnerability weights (the relative vulnerability of ecological features to specific human activities and their impacts) that were estimated based on a cumulative impact assessment, allowed the assessment of each zone in contributing to the achievement of conservation targets, through a transparent planning approach. Results indicate that special care should be given to how socio-economic activities, their impact on the ecosystems, and related costs are incorporated into planning. The proposed approach demonstrates how EU member states may effectively comply with the new Biodiversity Strategy 2030 targets, while planning for the sustainable use of their marine resources.},

  abstract = {The wind power industry has grown rapidly in the UK to meet EU targets of sourcing 20\% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Although wind power is a renewable energy source, there are environmental concerns over increasing numbers of wind farm proposals and associated cumulative impacts. Individually, a wind farm, or indeed any action, may have minor effects on the environment, but collectively these may be significant, potentially greater than the sum of the individual parts acting alone. EU and UK legislation requires a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as part of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). However, in the absence of detailed guidance and definitions, such assessments within EIA are rarely adequate, restricting the acquisition of basic knowledge about the cumulative impacts of wind farms on bird populations. Here we propose a conceptual framework to promote transparency in CIA through the explicit definition of impacts, actions and scales within an assessment. our framework requires improved legislative guidance on the actions to include in assessments, and advice on the appropriate baselines against which to assess impacts. Cumulative impacts are currently considered on restricted scales (spatial and temporal) relating to individual development EIAs. We propose that benefits would be gained from elevating CIA to a strategic level, as a component of spatially explicit planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Acknowledging and accounting for the interplay between climate change, the vulnerability of coastal populations and the occurrence of maritime criminality should be part of any ocean governance process. Still, given the complex interactions between climate change and socio-economic components of the marine realm, it has become urgent to establish a solid methodological framework, which could lead to sound and effective decisions. We propose that any such framework should not be built from scratch. The adaptation of well tested, existing uncertainty-management tools, such as Cumulative Effect Assessments, could serve as a solid basis to account for the magnitude and directionality of the dependencies between the impacts of climate change and the occurrence of maritime criminality, offering spatial explicit risk evaluations. Multi-Criteria Decision Making could then be employed to better and faster inform decision-makers. These mechanisms could provide a framework for comparison of alternative mitigation and adaptation actions and are essential in assessing responses to tackle maritime crime in the context of climate change.

  abstract = {Environmental concerns such as loss of biological diversity and stratospheric ozone depletion have heightened awareness of the need to assess cumulative impacts in environmental documents. More than 20 years of experience with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) have provided analysts in the United States with opportunities for developing successful techniques to assess site-specific impacts of proposed actions. Methods for analyzing a proposed action's incremental contribution to cumulative impacts are generally less advanced than those for project-specific impacts. The President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) defines cumulative impact to include the impacts of `'past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions” regardless of who undertakes the action. Court decisions have helped clarify the distinction between reasonably foreseeable future actions and other possible future actions. This paper seeks to clarify how past acid present impacts should be included in cumulative impact analyses. The definition of cumulative impacts implies that cumulative impact analyses should include the effects of all past and present actions on a particular resource. Including past and present impacts in cumulative impact assessments increases the likelihood of identifying significant impacts. NEPA requires agencies to give more consideration to alternatives and mitigation and to provide more opportunities for public involvement for actions that would have significant impacts than for actions that would not cause or contribute to significant impacts. For an action that would contribute to significant cumulative impacts, the additional cost and effort involved in increased consideration of alternatives and mitigation and in additional public involvement may be avoided if the action can be modified so that its contributions to significant cumulative impacts are eliminated.},

  abstract = {The nation's estuaries are at risk of further deterioration from land use change and intensification. These risks include direct impacts on wetland habitats and stream environments and indirect impacts from nonpoint source pollutant loading. This article reports on the methods, findings, and policy implications of a major study, “The Effects of Land Use Change and Intensification on the San Francisco Estuary.” By using a geographic information system (GIS), future growth scenarios were played out and the impacts on wetlands, streams, and water quality were estimated on a regionwide basis. The land use scenario developed from the General Plans of the Bay-Delta Region's 12 counties shows that the total area planned as urban use outside existing incorporated cities is 331,530 acres, an increase of 3 7\%. This land use change and intensification associated with increased growth will continue to stress an overtaxed estuarine system. Results are expressed according to 14 receiving water segments and the associated 34 watersheds. Direct impacts on wetlands and strewn environment zones occur in every watershed containing these resources. We estimate that over 39,500 acres of wetlands may be.potentially impacted. Of 377,000 acres of stream environment in the 12-county study area, 28,000 acres are also subject to impacts of urbanization. Our analysis suggests that protection of farmed wetlands in the Delta and North Bay and the enhancement of biodiversity in the South Bay deserve special attention. The construction of land use scenarios for the estuary region has presented, for the first time, an opportunity to examine the cumulative contribution of nonpoint source urban runoff to the levels of pollutants in the bay and delta. To date, more modest studies in smaller urban watersheds have provided only a glimpse of the overall effect that urbanization has in a region the size of the estuary. We found that these impacts can be expected to decrease the overall water quality of the estuary. The existing system of land use planning delegates responsibility to local governments. However, of 111 jurisdictions within the estuary study region, only 18 have specific ordinances to protect streams and wetlands. We recommend that the existing system regulation and management be strengthened to protect, enhance, and restore the environmental well-being of the estuary. The results of our study suggest that improvements are needed in the goals, management strategies, and institutional arrangements now in place for the San Francisco estuary. We advance several specific management options to help frame the debate over strengthening estuarine management. In particular, we urge that a specific focus on estuarine resource protection be incorporated in any new growth management legislation enacted in California. We identify several important national policy implications arising from our study. First, we believe the potential transferability of our methodology to other estuaries should be investigated. Second, we recommend that technical workshops be convened for estuarine managers who are addressing similar management issues. Third, we recommend that policy guidance to encourage the use of watersheds and receiving waters as the unit for analysis. We also recommend that GIS-based analysis should be used to test the implications of alternative wetland definitions to inform the national policy debate.},

The CEA incorporates five methodological advancements: (1) linear and non-linear ecosystem response to anthropogenic pressures/effects, (2) modelling of additive, dominant and antagonist stressor effects, (3) implementation of a convolution distance model for stressor dispersion modelling, (4) application of a CEA backsourcing (CEA-B) model to identify and quantify sources of anthropogenic pressures affecting environmental components, based on the convolution distance model and (5) a novel CEA impact chain visualization tool based on Sankey diagrams. Results from CEA in the Italian Adriatic Sea show that highest CEA scores are located in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Port of Trieste and Venice Lagoon inlets) while abrasion, marine litter and selective extraction are the most pronounced pressures within the 12\,nm. Results from CEA-B application for two case studies evidence a clear distinction among local human impacts (trawling, small scale fishery) versus long-range diffusive human impacts (underwater noise and marine litter). Results were discussed for their geospatial outcomes, importance for transboundary effects assessment, conservation planning and future application potentials.},

The paper presents a comprehensive set of built-in geospatial webtools to support Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and environmental management objectives implemented into the Tools4MSP interoperable GeoPlatform. The webtools include cumulative effects assessment (CEA), maritime use conflict (MUC) analysis, MSFD pressure-driven CEA and a CEA-based marine ecosystem service threat analysis (MES-Threat). The tools are tested for the Northern Adriatic (NA) Sea, one of the most industrialized sea areas of Europe using a case study driven modelling strategy. Overall results show that coastal areas within 0-9 nm in the Gulf of Trieste, Grado-Marano and Venice lagoon and Po Delta outlet are subjected to intense cumulative effects and high sea use conflicts mainly from port activities, fishery, coastal and maritime tourism and maritime shipping. Linking MES into CEA provided novel information on locally threatened high MES supporting and provisioning habitats such Cymodocea beds and infralittoral fine sands, threats to cultural MES are most pronounced in coastal areas. Results are discussed for their geospatial relevance for regional planning, resource management and their applicability within MSP and environmental assessment.},

The suite was initially developed within the ADRIPLAN data portal, that has been recently upgraded into the Tools4MSP Geoplatform (data.tools4msp.eu), an integrated web platform that supports MSP through the application of different tools, e.g., collaborative geospatial modelling of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) and marine use conflict (MUC) analysis. The package can be used as stand-alone library or as collaborative webtool, providing userfriendly interfaces appropriate to decision-makers, regional authorities, academics and MSP stakeholders. An effective MSP-oriented integrated system of web-based software, users and services is proposed. It includes four components: the Tools4MSP Geoplatform for interoperable and collaborative sharing of geospatial datasets and for MSP-oriented analysis, the Tools4MSP package as stand-alone library for advanced geospatial and statistical analysis, the desktop applications to simplify data curation and the third party data repositories for multidisciplinary and multilevel geospatial datasets integration. The paper presents an application example of the Tools4MSP GeoNode plugin and an example of Tools4MSP stand-alone library for CEA in the Adriatic Sea. The Tools4MSP and the developed software have been released as FOSS under the GPL 3 license and are currently under further development.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation of marine ecosystems requires the assessment and management of cumulative impacts of multiple activities occurring in the ecosystem. Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2\%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31\%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3\%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21\%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives.},

  abstract = {Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador is an artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) region with approximately 6000 gold miners working with mercury and cyanide. Although artisanal gold mining (AGM) has taken place in Portovelo-Zaruma for centuries, highly mechanized small-scale gold mining (SGM) processing plants capable of increased throughput began being built in the 1990s. While there are benefits associated with ASGM, there are also negative impacts experienced by the miners and the surrounding communities. To take advantage of ASGM as a poverty-alleviating mechanism while reducing unwanted externalities, the cumulative impacts must be understood. Numerous challenges to measuring, monitoring, and addressing ASGM impacts result from the complexity of the impacts themselves, the nature of the gold mining as an informal industry, and the shortfalls in the current regulatory framework. These are discussed in the context of ongoing, unresolved issues including efforts to address trans-boundary water pollution, management of mining waste, and conflicts regarding priorities, ambiguities, and enforcement of existing regulations and policies. Internationally, interventions to address both AGM and SGM impacts have typically focused almost exclusively on technological changes through the elimination of mercury use. Our analysis suggests that to better address ASGM and their cumulative impacts in Ecuador, it will be beneficial to revisit the legal definitions of AGM and SGM. Additionally, promotion of information-based strategies including educational outreach programs and cross-scale and cross-level mitigation methods may also be beneficial. The success of these strategies to reduce ASGM-related cumulative impacts will depend on sufficient funding and the commitment of stakeholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a synopsis on social indicators as relevant to cumulative effects assessment and land use planning. Although much has been done to better understand the social dimensions of environmental assessment, empirical work has been lacking on social indicators that could be used either as measurable inputs or outputs for cumulative effects assessment and land use planning in different kinds of communities and regions. Cumulative effects models currently in practice often fail to address deeper issues of community and regional well-being. Against this gap, social scientists are being asked to make reliable generalizations about functional, measurable relationships between certain social indicators and land use change or scenarios. To address this challenge, the Alberta Research Council held a two-day workshop in 2005 with social scientists. The workshop resulted in a list of prioritized social indicators that could be included in cumulative effects modeling/assessments and land use planning. The top five social indicators included population growth rate, education attainment, self-assessed quality of life, equity, i.e., distribution of benefits, and locus of control. Although consensus on social indicators and social thresholds for cumulative effects models was not reached, the insight gained from the workshop will help inform future cumulative effects assessment and land use planning.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is being given to understanding how intensifying human activities combine over space and time to influence persistence of biodiversity. Two types of biodiversity assessment in particular are attracting growing interest: one focused on understanding past-to-present change (environmental accounting) and another focused on understanding likely present-to-future changes under proposed scenarios of future actions (cumulative impact assessment of scenarios). Here we highlight the potential benefits of improving the links between environmental accounting and scenario-based cumulative impact assessment for biodiversity, using a case study for subterranean fauna in the Pilbara region of Australia. Using a flexible and comprehensive model-based analytical approach, we assessed expected change in biodiversity persistence given past development, and likely change to 2100 under a proposed development scenario for the region. Our assessment shows both the times (2005-2015) and places (Fortescue sub-region) where development activities are likely to have most strongly influenced long-term biodiversity persistence for subterranean fauna in the Pilbara region. Although mining development has often occurred in areas that have a high value for subterranean fauna diversity, our linked environmental accounting and cumulative impact assessment suggest relatively modest impacts on long-term persistence for this component of biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides an effective demonstration of the capacity and potential benefits of better linking environmental accounting with scenario-based cumulative impact assessment. Improving the links between these two perspectives on biodiversity assessment will create benefits for both, providing a consistent basis for cumulative impact assessments and enhancing the usefulness of environmental accounting.},

  abstract = {The environmental impact assessment is a process required in many countries. It highlights future activities with a significant impact on the environment. Water, as an environmental factor, needs adequate methods for quantifying cumulative impact of hydrotechnical works. In most cases, for new developments, baseline data is collected before the beginning of the construction, but for waterworks already in place, a different approach is needed. In line with the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC), the overall purpose of the research is to develop an approach for the hydromorphological cumulative impact assessment integrating different spatial scales for existing water intakes with transversal barriers on mountain rivers in Romania. Being a research study developed for a specific issue-post-construction impact assessment, some innovative actions were required. Lack of information in the pre-construction phase was an important constraint. Customizing formulas of certain indicators established within the Romanian method for hydromorphological status assessment of rivers proved to be a practical solution to show both local and waterbody hydromorphological impact. Upscaling the impact from the local scale to the river sector and the waterbody allows awareness of the spatial extent of the impact and understanding of the importance of the thresholds of significant impact for a broader audience. In order to better highlight the approach, this paper shows practical examples. The whole chain of the drivers-pressures-state-impacts-responses (DPSIR) framework is applied in the case of two river water bodies with hydropower generation facilities in place. In addition, some recommendations for actions are provided.},

  abstract = {It is commonly recognized that there are constraints to successful regional-scale assessment and monitoring of cumulative impacts because of challenges in the selection of coherent and measurable indicators of the effects. It has also been sensibly declared that the connections between components in a region are as important as the state of the elements themselves. These have previously been termed “linked” cumulative impacts/effects. These connections can be difficult to discern because of a complicated set of interactions and unexpected linkages. In this paper we diagnose that a significant cause of these constraints is the selection of indicators without due regard for their inter-relationships in the formulation of the indicator set. The paper examines whether the common “forms of capital”, i.e., natural (renewable and non-renewable), manufactured, social, human and financial capitals, framework is a potential organizing structure. We examine a large region in western NSW Australia where the predominant production systems are mining and grazing for production of wool, beef and lamb. Production in both is driven by consumption of a non-renewable resource, i.e., ore for mining and topsoil for grazing, the latter on the basis that loss rate estimates far exceed soil formation rates. We propose that the challenge of identifying connections of components within and between capital stores can be approached by explicitly separating stores of capital and the flows of capital between stores and between elements within stores, so-called capital fluxes. We attempt to acquire data from public sources for both capital stores and fluxes. The question of whether these data are a sufficient base for regional assessment, with particular reference to connections, is discussed. The well-described challenge of a comparative common currency for stores and fluxes is also discussed. We conclude that the data acquisition is relatively successful for stores and fluxes. A number of linked impacts are identified and discussed. The potential use of money as the common currency for stores and fluxes of capital is considered. The basic proposition is that replacement or preservation costs be used for this. We conclude that the study is sufficiently positive to consider further research in fully-coupled models of capital stores and fluxes. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Generally speaking, there is a greater amount of quantitative data available to measure and model the cumulative environmental or economic impacts of mining than the social impacts. In part, this is because social impacts are often inherently more difficult to quantify, but historically there have also been fewer regulatory drivers for companies or state agencies to invest in collecting such data. Regulators in some jurisdictions are now starting to require resource companies to report on aspects of their social performance, but companies and regulators are still struggling to identify appropriate metrics, particularly in regards to cumulative impacts. This paper describes an innovative quantitative approach to tracking how communities experience and respond to increased mining activity, using data from the complaints registers maintained by mines located in the Upper Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia. In this study, complaints lodged with five separate mines adjacent to the township of Muswellbrook over several years were aggregated and trends analysed. The aggregated set showed that complaint frequency increased with the increase in mining activity but then decreased as individual complaints were addressed. However, when complaints from near-neighbours were removed, it emerged that the proportion of complaints that came from the town itself steadily increased over time. Further analysis indicated that this increase was closely associated with the amount of mine-disturbed land that could be seen from the town over time, as measured using a combination of remotely sensed data and a digital elevation model. This is persuasive evidence of a cumulative social impact that is more than just the sum of the local impacts of individual mines. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The recently developed concepts of aggregate risk and cumulative risk rectify two limitations associated with the classical risk assessment paradigm established in the early 1980s. Aggregate exposure denotes the amount of one pollutant available at the biological exchange boundaries from multiple routes of exposure. Cumulative risk assessment is defined as an assessment of risk from the accumulation of a common toxic effect from all routes of exposure to multiple chemicals sharing a common mechanism of toxicity. Thus, cumulative risk constitutes an improvement over the classical risk paradigm, which treats exposures from multiple routes as independent events associated with each specific route. Risk assessors formulate complex models and identify many realistic scenarios of exposure that enable them to estimate risks from exposures to multiple pollutants and multiple routes. The increase in complexity of the risk assessment process is likely to increase risk uncertainty. Despite evidence that scenario and model uncertainty contribute to the overall uncertainty of cumulative risk estimates, present uncertainty analysis of risk estimates accounts only for parameter uncertainty and excludes model and scenario uncertainties. This paper provides a synopsis of the risk assessment evolution and associated uncertainty analysis methods. This evolution leads to the concept of the scenario - model- parameter (SMP) cumulative risk uncertainty analysis method. The SMP uncertainty analysis is a multiple step procedure that assesses uncertainty associated with the use of judiciously selected scenarios and models of exposure and risk. Ultimately, the SMP uncertainty analysis method compares risk uncertainty estimates determined using all three sources of uncertainty with conventional risk uncertainty estimates obtained using only the parameter source. An example of applying the SMP uncertainty analysis to cumulative risk estimates from exposures to two pesticides indicates that inclusion of scenario and model sources increases uncertainty of risk estimates relative to those estimated using only the parameter source. Changes in uncertainty magnitude may affect decisions made by risk managers. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Legal challenges have played an important role in shaping the practices and policies of impact assessment (IA) for more than half a century. Early cases provided the impetus to the development of initial approaches upon which conventional cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM) frameworks are based. Outcomes of these challenges, when examined from IA perspectives such as CEAM, often serve as important learning opportunities for jurisdictions updating policies and practices in addition to those considering (or needing to undergo) a paradigm shift. Failures and consequences identified therein and the associated implications provide important insights for both decision-makers and those adversely affected. This paper examines the Yahey v. British Columbia (2021) legal decision by a Canadian court that concluded British Columbia's provincial government failed to implement a credible CEAM framework and protect the cultural sustainability of Indigenous peoples. The paper summarises the deficiencies and consequences of the provincial CEAM framework based on the analysis that the court provided in its reasons for decision. These are followed by a critical viewpoint of the current practices concerning the key implications associated with the legal requisite to integrate the cultural ways of life into CEAM and IA more broadly. This discussion combines the extant literature with the findings and conclusions of the court. Each tier (i.e., policy, plan, programme, project) of environmental decision-making contributed to these failures, which makes the decision the most critical analysis and a potentially transformative ruling for project and regional assessments that involve Indigenous peoples.},

  abstract = {Until recently, environmental assessments were conducted without regard to either upstream or downstream developments, such that the relative contributions of individual developments could not be separated. The environmental legislative agenda in Canada has been proceeding at a pace where there is an expectation to address the cumulative effects of existing developments prior to the development of methodology for conducting these assessments. We initiated a long-term study in 1991 which is attempting to address the cumulative aquatic effects of hydroelectric facilities and pulp mill discharges on fish populations within the Moose River basin in Northern Ontario. The focus is placed on the top-down interpretation of the impact of alterations in habitat and fish energetics associated with damage at the fish population level and not on detailed initial characterization of stressors. This approach allows follow-up studies to focus on the critical areas associated with responses of surviving fish within the watersheds in an attempt to identify limiting environmental conditions and the responsible stressors. The objectives of the project are to provide an interpretation framework using traditional fisheries information to assess the integrated effects of all stressors on the populations at risk and to isolate key areas and critical stages in life history associated with those changes in fish populations.},

  abstract = {The regulation of groundwater extraction has shifted, almost seismically, through Australia's water reform era, which culminated in the National Water Initiative and the federal Water Act 2007 (Cth). Its starting point was minimal regulation, targeted at controlling selected extractions and pursuing sustainability for consumptive purposes. Since then, groundwater laws have imported regulatory concepts from the surface water sphere; among them, regulating extraction through statutory plans and in a broad-based way, and protecting dependent ecosystems. One issue emerges at the heart of both the history and future of groundwater reform: dealing with the cumulative impacts of extraction. This article reviews how groundwater reforms in Australia have approached cumulative impacts - albeit often implicitly rather than explicitly measured against concepts of cumulative impact assessment derived from the scientific environmental assessment literature. It finds that both regulatory and non-regulatory, incentive-based measures have been used. As water reforms have progressed, arrangements for assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of groundwater extraction have taken a dramatically broader view of potentially affected natural systems, as well as consumptive values. However, they have not focused significantly on the implications of connections between natural systems. Reforms have also resulted in a much broader view of the impacting activities that are relevant to an assessment of cumulative impacts, though often with an unclear temporal scope. Remaining weaknesses in approaches to managing cumulative impacts and a lack of empirical evidence as to the effectiveness of existing measures warrant attention. The article concludes by charting key challenges that remain for resolution, and setting out an accompanying research and reform agenda.},

A key driver for the decline is excess urban stormwater runoff caused by the cumulative effects of urban developments. Inspired by insights from scientific studies of cumulative environmental effects, this article undertakes a traditional legal analysis across five areas of law to explore their potential to address this problem, and pioneers an approach to spatio-legal analysis to understand key gaps in the application of legal mechanisms to Melbourne. Although many legal mechanisms might be used to address sick city streams, and despite significant recent reforms, many lack strong goals and quantitative standards, and the strength of legal controls varies greatly across Melbourne. The Yarra Strategic Plan under the groundbreaking Yarra River Protection (Wilip-gin Birrarung murron) Act 2017 (Vic) presents an opportunity to pilot an improved approach to protecting and restoring city streams in the context of the stormwater impacts of intensifying development.},

  abstract = {This article examines watershed cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM) in the Athabasca watershed, Alberta, Canada. Using a focus group and semi-structured interviews with 30 key informants from government, industry, NGOs, and First Nations, watershed CEAM was examined based on eight requisites to support CEAM: the presence of a lead agency; enabling legislation; financial and human resources; data management and coordination; multi-scaled monitoring; CEAM baselines, indicators, and thresholds; mult-istakeholder collaboration; and vertical and horizontal linkages. Results show that while there was broad agreement amongst participants concerning the necessity for these requisites, there was also considerable uncertainty respecting these requisite performances in this watershed. Several contributing factors may help explain this uncertainty. Participants noted a lack of willingness to share data to support CEAM, especially spatial data, as well as a lack of confidence in the integrity of water monitoring data. An absence of coordination and leadership for watershed CEAM has contributed to financial, human, and technical capacity limitations as well as power asymmetries respecting multi-stakeholder engagement. Our results suggest that notwithstanding investment in cumulative effects science and monitoring in the Athabasca, advancing watershed CEAM requires much greater attention to the institutional requisites to implement and sustain CEAM programs.},

  abstract = {Canada's watersheds are under increasing pressure from the cumulative effects of human development. There is a recognized need to assess and manage cumulative effects to Canada's watersheds, but there has been limited assessment of the current capacity for cumulative effects assessment and management. This paper assesses the current capacity to implement and sustain watershed-based cumulative effects assessment and management in the South Saskatchewan Watershed. Eight core requisites and 40 capacity indicators for watershed cumulative effects assessment and management are assessed based on a survey of 73 watershed stakeholders. Results indicate that many of the perceived threats to the health of the South Saskatchewan Watershed are not subject to regulatory environmental assessment. Participants identified leadership and multi-stakeholder collaboration as the most important requisites for watershed cumulative effects assessment and management, but under-valued the importance of vertical and horizontal linkages to ensure that watershed plans and monitoring programs provide sufficient guidance to land uses and project development decisions. Participants believed current capacity to be lacking, or limited, across most assessment indicators, with data management and coordination and resources to ensure the long-term sustainability of watershed cumulative effects assessment and management as the most significant capacity constraints. Advancing watershed cumulative effects assessment and management in the South Saskatchewan Watershed requires a lead agency or consortium of agencies with a clear mandate for cumulative effects assessment, the legislated or regulatory means to ensure that watershed efforts influence land and water use and allocation decisions, the coordination of data and provision of specific guidance to monitoring programs, and long-term financial investment.},

A case study of the hydroelectric sector is used to determine whether sufficient information is available over time through project-by-project assessments to support an adequate understanding of cumulative change. Results show inconsistency from one project to the next in terms of the components and indicators assessed, limited transfer of baseline information between project assessments over time, and the same issues and concerns being raised by review panels–even though the projects reviewed are operating in the same watershed and operated by the same proponent. Project environmental assessments must be managed, and coordinated, as part of a larger system of impact assessment, if project-by-project assessments are to provide a meaningful forum for learning and understanding cumulative change. The paper concludes with recommendations for improved project-based assessment practice in support of cumulative effects assessment and management.},

  abstract = {Valued ecosystem component (VEC) selection is a core component of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) and gives direction to impact analysis, mitigation and monitoring. Yet little is known about CEA VEC selection practices. This paper examines 11 Canadian road infrastructure project CEAs completed between 1995 and 2011 to determine how VEC selection in CEA is performed, and whether these practices are sensitive to the linear project development context. Document review and semi-structured interviews reveal an absence of VEC selection guidance, late timing of cumulative effects considerations in impact assessment, lack of sensitivity in CEA VEC selection to the unique, linear nature of the road construction projects and a general lack of insightful, creative approaches to CEA VEC selection - ones that better reflect potential impacts to social and economic aspects of the environment - despite it being shown to be a values-driven, subjective process. There is a clear need for regional databases to support consistent CEA VEC selection processes, and the development of CEA-specific VEC selection guidance.},

  abstract = {Regional environmental assessment (EA) requires the participation of policy- and plan-making institutions to formulate, implement and monitor regional environmental management strategies. However, there is little understanding of what effective integration is in the context of regional EA and from the perspectives of planners and policy-makers involved. This paper seeks to explore how institutional actors perceive cross-domain integration vis-a-vis their own involvement in regional EAs. Thirty-eight participants from four regional EA initiatives in Canada shared their perspectives in an online survey. Three types of silo effects are identified: (1) institutional - intricately linked to factors such as coordination, goals and expectations, leadership and capacity; (2) disciplinary - characterized by limited communication and scepticism around data sharing; and (3) transactional - tendency of actors to emphasize individual narrow perspective rather than collective social and environmental outcomes. Additional findings reveal the importance of learning and multiple domain expertise as opportunities for enhancing cross-domain integration in regional EA practice. Finally, the study concludes that proactive consideration of potential silo effects is necessary for improved regional EA outcomes, and to facilitate more effective regional resource governance.},

These questions are important because their answers determine whether conduct that results in a seemingly minor level of environmental harm will-or will not-be subject to a given regulatory regime, which in turn creates the potential for environmental degradation through cumulative effects. Part I observes that there is considerable confusion about whether the maxim is ever applicable in the Canadian environmental law context, but concludes that it is applicable in certain legislative circumstances. Part II argues that the prevailing conception of de minimis as a single-step test concerned only with the magnitude of environmental harm in isolation is incorrect; rather, the foundational jurisprudence points to a two-step test that considers the potential for cumulative effects. This Part also examines recent developments in cumulative effects assessment and the emerging paradigm of risk-based regulation in order to shed some modern light on this ancient maxim's application. The article concludes by considering the implications of applying de minimis in this way for regulators, industry and the public.},

  abstract = {Identifying key indicator species, their life cycle dynamics and the multiple driving forces they are affected by is an important step in ecosystem-based management. Similarly important is understanding how environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and service provision. We here present a statistical modelling framework to assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or magnified. Our novel modelling approach reliably captures the historical P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors, salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate that population responses to stressors are dampened through density effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in predation pressure by 50\% each could counteract the negative effect of a 25\% decrease in salinity by only 6\%. We therefore advocate that management strategies aimed to mitigate the effects of climate-related stressors should target life stage not affected by climate for more effective and predictable results. Our modelling framework can help here as simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change.},

Limits to scientific and technical assessment, issues of power and control of information, and episodic forms of civic engagement represent serious challenges to meaningful understanding of cumulative effects assessment and land-use planning. In articulating these challenges, I draw on case studies from Ontario's Lands for Life and Alberta's Land-use Framework to illustrate current limitations to cumulative effects assessment on public lands in Canada. As a partial remedy for these limitations, insights into a pragmatic approach to impact assessment, in contrast to decisionistic and technocratic approaches, offer a way forward through a more robust integration of scientific information, civic engagement, and public policy development. I also identify a need for longer-standing institutions that are dedicated to regional planning and cumulative effects assessment in Canada.},

Several factors that may influence the consideration of connectivity were analyzed in an evaluation of 14 environmental impact statements (EIS) obtained from the Canadian Impact Assessment Registry. Connectivity is largely absent from the EIA process, and even projects that attempted to consider connectivity lacked the rigor required to effectively assess impacts on connectivity. Projects that included connectivity as a valued component performed somewhat better, whereas the assessment of connectivity was not affected by different federal environmental acts (CEAA 1992 vs. CEAA 2012), development sectors, or proponent types. Between sections of the EIS, a significantly greater number of evaluation criteria were met in the scoping section compared to all other sections. Without adequate guidance, connectivity analysis in EIA has been conducted ad hoc, with considerable variation in quality. Including connectivity consideration in EIA legislation would provide a legal framework to address the lack of policies, standards, and assessment guidelines. We provide recommendations for integrating connectivity in EIA in Canada and elsewhere.},

Together with an outline of these requirements from CEA key literature, the various definitions of cumulative effects point to the direction of a method for causality analysis that is visually-oriented and qualitative. This article consequently revisits network and system diagrams, resolves their reported shortcomings, and extends their capabilities with causal loop diagramming methodology. The application of the resulting composite causality analysis method to three Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) case studies appears to satisfy the specific requirements of CEA regarding causality. Three “moments” are envisaged for the use of the proposed method: during the scoping stage, during the assessment process, and during the stakeholder participation process. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Currently most Cumulative Impacts Assessments (CIAs) are risk-based approaches that assess the potential impact of human activities and their pressures on the ecosystem thereby compromising the achievement of policy objectives. While some of these CIAs apply actual data (usually spatial distributions) they often have to rely on categorical scores based on expert judgement if they actually assess impact which is often expressed as a relative measure that is difficult to interpret in absolute terms. Here we present a first step-wise approach to conduct a fully quantitative CIA based on the selection and subsequent application of the best information available. This approach systematically disentangles risk into its exposure and effect components that can be quantified using known ecological information, e.g. spatial distribution of pressures or species, pressure-state relationships and population dynamics models with appropriate parametrisation, resulting in well-defined assessment endpoints that are meaningful and can be easily communicated to the recipients of advice. This approach requires that underlying assumptions and methodological considerations are made explicit and translated into a measure of confidence. This transparency helps to identify the possible data-handling or methodological decisions and shows the resulting improvement through its confidence assessment of the applied information and hence the resulting accuracy of the CIA. To illustrate this approach, we applied it in a North Sea CIA focussing on two sectors, i.e. fisheries and offshore windfarms, and how they impact the ecosystem and its components, i.e. seabirds, seabed habitats and marine mammals through various pressures. The results provide a “proof of concept” for this generic approach as well as rigorous definitions of several of the concepts often used as part of risk-based approaches, e.g. exposure, sensitivity, vulnerability, and how these can be estimated using actual data.

  abstract = {This study introduces SCAIRM, a Spatially explicit Cumulative Impact Assessment method specifically developed for application to guide Ecosystem-Based Management. The method incorporates relevant human activities, their pressures and their impacts on ecosystem components. Cumulative assessment methods usually apply categorical semi-quantitative scores based on expert judgement in order to be comprehensive, or alternatively, only cover a small subset of interactions using more sophisticated quantitative information. The SCAIRM approach aims to capture `the best of both worlds': it builds on categorical risk-based approaches, but modified such that their outcome, i.e. Impact Risk from cumulative pressures, is conceptually identical to the outcome from the quantitative approaches. This allows harmonization of qualitative and quantitative approaches into a single method, that has the advantage that it is comprehensive and can be used in data-poor situations while allowing the use of available quantitative information in more data-rich situations. It results in an improved capacity to inform policy or provide operational-centric guidance required for the essentially sectoral management. The method was applied to the North Sea ecosystem as an illustrative example of the typical output of most Cumulative Impact Assessments: indicating the ecosystem components mostly under threat, and the main activities and their pressures responsible for it. To that end, SCAIRM provides an assessment outcome expressed in ecologically meaningful terms, i.e. potential change in state compared to an undisturbed situation, implying all receptors except the pelagic water column to be potentially “endangered” (more than 50\% decrease) and requiring conservation efforts. A decision tree was developed to guide management towards an increased effectiveness showing that much of the Impact Risk (41\%) is caused by few well-known stressors (7\%) that are difficult to mitigate but a remaining 29\% of the Impact Risk from many often lesser-known stressors (59\%) where management is likely to perform better.},

  abstract = {The challenge of balancing biodiversity protection with economic growth is epitomized by the development of renewable and unconventional energy, whose adoption is aimed at stemming the impacts of global climate change, yet has outpaced our understanding of biodiversity impacts. We evaluated the potential conflict between biodiversity protection and future electricity generation from renewable (wind farms, run-of-river hydro) and non-renewable (shale gas) sources in British Columbia (BC), Canada using three metrics: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electricity cost, and overlap between future development and conservation priorities for several fish and wildlife groups - small-bodied vertebrates, large mammals, freshwater fish - and undisturbed landscapes. Sharp trade-offs in global versus regional biodiversity conservation exist for all energy technologies, and in BC they are currently smallest for wind energy: low GHG emissions, low-moderate overlap with top conservation priorities, and competitive energy cost. GHG emissions from shale gas are 1000 times higher than those from renewable sources, and run-of-river hydro has high overlap with conservation priorities for small-bodied vertebrates. When all species groups were considered simultaneously, run-of-river hydro had moderate overlap (0.56), while shale gas and onshore wind had low overlap with top conservation priorities (0.23 and 0.24, respectively). The unintended cost of distributed energy sources for regional biodiversity suggest that trade-offs based on more diverse metrics must be incorporated into energy planning.},

As a result, there is an increasing prevalence and awareness of the cumulative impacts of the extractive resource industries on the society, environment and economy of these regions. Collaborative governance is emerging as a means of addressing cumulative impacts. This article undertakes an analysis of 30 case studies of collaborative governance in the resources sector of Australia. The initiatives analysed range from those focussed on information exchange and coordination to higher degrees of collaboration that involve shared resources and shared risks. The study demonstrates that there are challenges in using collaborative approaches to tackle cumulative impacts, but that significant benefits can be realised. The study highlights the need to nurture and cultivate collaborative relationships in order to provide the foundation for long-term solutions. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The wetland of focus, Inle Lake, located in centralMyanmar, is well known for its unique biodiversity and culture, as well as for ingenious floating garden agriculture. During the last decades, the lake area has seen extensive degradation in terms of water quality, erosion, deforestation, and biodiversity concomitant with a major shift to unsustainable land use. The study was conducted, with an emphasis on water quality, to analyze environmental impacts (effects) changing the ecosystem and to comprehensively evaluate the environmental state of the ecosystem through an innovative Rapid Cumulative Effects Assessment framework tool. The assessment started with a framework-forming Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which quantified and prioritized impacts over space and time. Critically important impacts were assessed for “intra-inter interactions” using the loop analysis simulation. Water samples were analyzed while geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing were used to identify water pollution hotspots. It was concluded that out of a plethora of impacts, pollution from municipal sources, sedimentation, and effects exerted by floating gardens had the most detrimental impacts, which cumulatively affected the entire ecosystem. The framework tool was designed in a broad sense with a reference to highly needed assessments of poorly studied wetlands where degradation is evident, but scarcely quantified, and where long- term field studies are fraught with security issues and resource unavailability (post- conflict, poor and remote regions, e.g., Afghanistan, Laos, Sudan, etc.)},

Once an uncertain and new area, it is now ubiquitous in the approval process for projects across the world. It is trite law to say that the impacts of proposed activities should be considered in the process to determine whether the proposed activities should be permitted. However, EIA is often understood broadly and leaves many issues unresolved. What is an impact of development? How far removed (how indirect) can the impacts be that an EIA can consider? What about the cumulative impacts of similar projects? When can these be taken into account? This article identifies three contemporary issues in EIA, assessed in the context of climate change: the scope of EIA, cumulative impacts and temporal problems.},

  abstract = {The implementation of the European integrated marine policy poses many scientific challenges. Among them, the knowledge and understanding of interactions between anthropogenic pressures and ecological components is an important issue, particularly to help define Good Environmental Status, environmental targets and monitoring programs of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008, MSFD). Assessment of cumulative effects of different pressures is a particularly complex issue requiring modeling tools and methods, as well as accurate data sets on human activities, anthropogenic pressures and ecological components. The results of these assessments are also uncertain and highly dependent on the calculation methods and assumptions, as well as on the data sets used. Within this context, we developed a technical and methodological approach to map the risk of cumulative effects of different pressures on benthic habitats. These developments were initiated as part of the implementation of the MSFD in France to contribute to the diagnosis of the marine environment. Here we provide a demonstrator to illustrate the feasibility for mapping the risk of cumulative effects of different pressures on benthic habitats, as well as the confidence index and the variability associated with this analysis. The method is based on a spatial analysis using a mapping of benthic habitats and their sensitivity to pressures, as well as the distribution and intensity of human activities and associated pressures. We collected and prepared relatively accurate and consistent data sets to describe human activities and benthic habitats. Data sets are embedded into a grid that facilitates the management and analysis of the data and exploitation of the results. The demonstrator consists of a relational database using the Spatial Query Language (SQL) language as well as data analysis scripts using the R language. The first demonstrator operations validated the main methodological and technical choices and helped to identify future developments needed to facilitate the appropriation and integration of these approaches in the implementation of public policies for the management of the marine environment.},

  abstract = {In Sweden, extractive industries are placing increasing pressure on the traditional indigenous Sami livelihood of reindeer herding. Consequently, the intersection of indigenous rights and mining-related development in Sweden has become an increasingly contested socio-legal space. In this article, we analyse the extent to which there are meaningful opportunities for Sami reindeer herding communities in Sweden to effectively influence the permit procedures concerning proposed mines, in order to protect their rights and interests. We provide a comprehensive socio-legal analysis that highlights the weak level of recognition of Sami rights and related impact assessments within the mining permitting system in Sweden. We demonstrate the weakness is caused by several factors: an a priori assumption by Swedish authorities that reindeer herding and mining can generally coexist; the lack of a codified Swedish State duty to consult the Sami; the narrow scope and the weak status of cumulative impact assessments in Swedish EIA legislation and practice; and the weak recognition of Sami reindeer herding as a “property right” during the permit review process under the balancing of competing land uses. Our results highlight the urgent need for legislative reform in Sweden, if the State is to fulfil its international obligations and improve its legal consistency concerning the rights of the Sami as an indigenous people.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are becoming increasingly threatened by human activities and there is growing appreciation that management must consider the impacts of multiple stressors. Cumulative effects assessments (CEAs) have become a popular tool for identifying the distribution and intensity of multiple human stressors in coastal ecosystems. Few studies, however, have demonstrated strong correlations between CEAs and change in ecosystem condition, questioning its management use. Here, we apply a CEA to the endangered seagrass Posidonia australis in Pittwater, NSW, Australia, using spatial data on known stressors to seagrass related to foreshore development, water quality, vessel traffic and fishing. We tested how well cumulative effects scores explained changes in P. australis extent measured between 2005 and 2019 using high-resolution aerial imagery. A negative correlation between P. australis and estimated cumulative effects scores was observed (R2 = 22 \%), and we identified a threshold of cumulative effects above which losses of P. australis became more likely. Using baited remote underwater video, we surveyed fishes over P. australis and non-vegetated sediments to infer and quantify how impacts of cumulative effects to P. australis extent would flow on to fish assemblages. P. australis contained a distinct assemblage of fish, and on non-vegetated sediments the abundance of sparids, which are of importance to fisheries, increased with closer proximity to P. australis. Our results demonstrate the negative impact of multiple stressors on P. australis and the consequences for fish biodiversity and fisheries production across much of the estuary. Management actions aimed at reducing or limiting cumulative effects to low and moderate levels will help conserve P. australis and its associated fish biodiversity and productivity.},

  abstract = {Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) emerged from Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) and was developed based on the procedural steps and understanding thereof, but with the goal to fulfil a more `strategic' function. Federal level plans and programmes constitute the highest planning levels in Germany subject to SEA, as SEA for policies is not compulsory. In this article, we analyse the quality and procedural effectiveness of federal level SEA in Germany with the underlying hypothesis that federal level SEA might be more strategic than SEA at other planning levels, as it represents the highest tier. Therefore, we analysed three federal level SEA case studies in Germany according to a set of criteria and indicators based on international research outcomes, including SEA integration into decision making, tiering, scoping, selection and assessment of alternatives, cumulative effects assessment, public participation, and monitoring. Results demonstrate that the procedural effectiveness of SEA practice at the federal level is limited in Germany, and the making of SEAs proved not to be as `strategic' as its important role prior to subsequent planning processes and outcomes would suggest. Reasons include an alternatives assessment restricted to macro siting instead of assessing scenarios of demand or system alternatives, tiering limited to general advice without specific guidance for subsequent planning levels, cumulative effects assessment limited to intra-plan effects, a lack of monitoring, and public participation limited to consultation on the environmental report. These findings support results from a variety of international studies. Reasons for limitations have been identified in current SEA regulations, prior policy-making, institutional settings, the institutions' willingness to learn and limited quality management by the German Federal Environmental Agency. Thus, our recommendations aim to improve quality management and learning by initiating a federal level SEA forum to discuss federal level planning and SEA practice and related issues, expanding the federal EIA portal to SEAs, quality management by the German Federal Environmental Agency in every federal level SEA scoping process and for every federal level environmental report, and further research and development to improve SEA practice. However, the general question for SEA research might be whether SEA contributes to long-term institutional learning processes beyond individual SEA processes, and how those learning processes can be supported, for instance by quality management and capacity building.},

  abstract = {SEA spread around the world as has SEA effectiveness research. International SEA evaluations show mixed findings on SEA effectiveness. In this article, the quality and procedural effectiveness of SEA in Germany is analysed pursuing the hypothesis that SEA is influenced by planning and administrative traditions that tend to counteract to more ambitious SEA approaches. Three SEA case studies were analysed according to a set of criteria and indicators based on international research outcomes involving SEA integration into decision-making, scoping, selection and assessment of alternatives, cumulative effects assessment, tiering, public participation, and monitoring. The analysis draws on documents analysis and interviews with representatives from responsible agencies and involved SEA consultancies. The analysis shows that SEA is facilitating informed decision-making as the responsible agencies used the SEA, the interaction with consultancies, and the participation processes as a source of information. However, the case studies show various degrees of SEA quality in Germany based on the evaluated criteria and indicators. Results demonstrate that procedural effectiveness is limited. Unclear legal regulations, an expert-based planning approach instead of a collaborative approach, and organisational constraints limit the SEA quality. Furthermore, SEA performance is highly influenced by administrations' legalistic tradition, the expert-based planning culture, the home-grown planning system, and the bounded importance of SEA consultancies in the era of staff cuts and under-resourced agencies. Thus, the recommendations aim to strengthen a more collaborative planning approach, to build SEA capacity within SEA responsible agencies, and to clarify SEA regulations. The overall question for SEA evaluation research and practice may be how more collaborative planning approaches can effectively be implemented in planning and SEA practice through institutional learning.},

  abstract = {Wildlife models focused solely on a single strong influence (e.g., habitat components, wildlife harvest) are limited in their ability to detect key mechanisms influencing population change. Instead, we propose integrated modeling in the context of cumulative effects assessment using multispecies population dynamics models linked to landscape-climate simulation at large spatial and temporal scales. We developed an integrated landscape and population simulation model using ALCES Online as the model-building platform, and the model accounted for key ecological components and relationships among moose (Alces alces), grey wolves (Canis lupus nubilus), and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in northern Ontario, Canada. We simulated multiple scenarios over 5 decades (beginning 2020) to explore sensitivity to climate change and land use and assessed effects at multiple scales. The magnitude of effect and the relative importance of key factors (climate change, roads, and habitat) differed depending on the scale of assessment. Across the full extent of the study area (654,311km2 [ecozonal scale]), the caribou population declined by 26\% largely because of climate change and associated predator-prey response, which led to caribou range recession in the southern part of the study area. At the caribou range scale (108,378 km2), which focused on 2 herds in the northern part of the study area, climate change led to a 10\% decline in the population and development led to an additional 7\% decline. At the project scale (8,331 km2), which was focused more narrowly on the landscape surrounding 4 proposed mines, the caribou population declined by 29\% largely in response to simulated development. Given that observed caribou population dynamics were sensitive to the cumulative effects of climate change, land use, interspecific interactions, and scale, insights from the analysis might not emerge under a less complex model. Our integrated modeling framework provides valuable support for broader regional assessments, including estimation of risk to caribou and Indigenous food security, and for developing and evaluating potential caribou recovery strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice of environmental impact assessments.},

  abstract = {1. In the Arctic, chemical contaminants, shipping, oil pollution, plastic pollution, changing habitats in relation to climate change and fisheries have been identified as environmental stressors to seabirds such as Fulmarus glacialis (northern fulmar; qaqulluk;.(sic)), but rarely have these stressors been considered within a cumulative effects framework in this species which is currently showing a declining populations trend. 2. As a novel tool to understand cumulative effects within a conservation context, we applied a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach that allows experts to arrange key factors and their interrelationships, organizing their understanding of the components of a complex issue into a graphical representation; a `cognitive map'. 3. This process was grounded in local environment concerns as documented in several Nunavut-specific reports and discussions, and worked with western-trained seabird experts with knowledge of northern fulmar populations to assess the inter-related environmental threats to fulmars as a way to combine these stressors in a cumulative effects framework and identify conservation actions and knowledge gaps. 4. We found strong agreement that the main stressors affecting northern fulmar populations in Canada include pollution (11\% total influence (TI)), shipping activities (16\% TI), hunting and fishing (18\% TI) and mining/oil and gas exploitation activities (22\% TI). 5. The indirect influence of threats on northern fulmar population size (57\% TI) exceeded the total direct influence (43\% TI), emphasizing the value of cognitive mapping in cumulative effects assessment for a more holistic understanding of interacting stressors. 6. Participants expressed substantial uncertainty regarding the strong relationships leading from the concepts, commercial fishing activity in the BBDS and the North Atlantic fisheries activity, indicating that these potential stressors require more research. 7. Similarly, uncertainty was expressed about the potential effects of zodiac traffic, ship strikes of northern fulmar, number of oil spills and magnitude of oil spills on northern fulmar. 8. By characterizing individual factors as manageable or not, we determined that stressors are largely manageable with enforcement of existing policies (58\% TI)-importantly, fishing activities were both highly influential on fulmars and deemed manageable, which will inform ongoing co-management planning in the region.},

  abstract = {An increasing human population is exerting greater demands upon the earth for resource production and living space. Despite its large landmass, Canada is not immune to this pressure. On industrial forested lands, one response has been integrated resource management, whereby the forest supports multiple uses within the same space and time. Under the strain of increasing pressures, coupled with a concern for the maintenance of natural systems and processes, it has become evident that the current planning processes need to evolve to incorporate a new land management paradigm. This paper outlines the issues and presents for discussion a potential management paradigm based not only on the limited scope of industrial forested lands but on the broader expanse of land management in general. Supporting the proposed Integrated Land Management (ILM) approach, Millar Western Forest Products Ltd., an Alberta-based forest products company, developed a cumulative effects assessment to complement its forest management plan. This assessment demonstrates that as a proof of concept, ILM is technically achievable and can be scientifically based. Further, integration of diverse concepts and disciplines can be organized to produce functional plans.},

  abstract = {As large migratory caribou herds decline globally and regional climate trends point to a warmer future, there is a need and a legislative requirement to ensure impacts of industrial development are fully assessed, particularly with respect to cumulative effects. In this paper we use a current proposal, the potential leasing of the 1002 lands on the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for hydrocarbon development, to project the potential cumulative effects on the international Porcupine Caribou Herd. Using the caribou cumulative effects model, an existing decision support tool, we evaluate six alternative development scenarios for the 1002 lands, ranging from no leasing to full leasing with standard mitigation conditions. Compared to the no leasing option, at the current population size (218,000 caribou), our analysis projected that the likelihood of a herd decline over a 10-year period would increase from 3\% to 19\% depending on the leasing scenarios analyzed. This compares to an increased probability of decline from 11\% to 26\% if the starting population was 100,000, indicative of population estimates in the early 1970s. Our approach accomplishes one of the main steps in a comprehensive cumulative effects assessment, namely the quantification of past, present, and foreseeable future projects on a valued ecosystem component, the Porcupine Caribou Herd. We suggest the testing of underlining assumptions and refinements of the model required to more fully estimate the impacts of development. The use of transparent, quantitative decision support tools in assessing industrial development impacts on Arctic wildlife becomes more critical as climatic changes to Arctic landscapes accelerate.},

  abstract = {Project-level impact assessment was originally conceived as a snapshot taken in advance of project implementation, contrasting current conditions with a likely future scenario involving a variety of predicted impacts. Current best practice guidance has encouraged a shift towards longitudinal assessments from the pre-project stage through the implementation and operating phases. Experience and study show, however, that assessment of infrastructure-intensive projects rarely endures past the project's construction phase. Negative consequences for environmental, social and health outcomes have been documented. Such consequences clarify the pressing need for longitudinal assessment in each of these domains, with human rights impact assessment (HRIA) as an umbrella over, and critical augmentation of, environmental, social and health assessments. Project impacts on human rights are more closely linked to political, economic and other factors beyond immediate effects of a company's policy and action throughout the project lifecycle. Delineating these processes requires an adequate framework, with strategies for collecting longitudinal data, protocols that provide core information for impact assessment and guidance for adaptive mitigation strategies as project-related effects change overtime. This article presents general principles for the design and implementation of sustained, longitudinal HRIA, based on experience assessing and responding to human rights impact in a uranium mining project in Malawi. The case study demonstrates the value of longitudinal assessment both for limiting corporate risk and improving human welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Fast-paced watershed change, driven by anthropogenic development, is threatening the sustainability of freshwater resources across the globe. Developments within watersheds interact in a manner that is additive and synergistic over space and time. Such cumulative environmental effects are defined as the results of actions that are individually minor but collectively significant when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) then is broadly defined as the process of evaluating the potential impacts of such collective actions on the environment and is a requirement in many countries, including in Canada at the federal level under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. However, current approaches to CEA for river systems are proving to be ineffective, which is largely attributed to the disconnect between CEA science and practice. We highlight this gap herein by discussing contradictions in the CEA literature, challenges in quantifying cumulative interactions, including overcoming spatiotemporal scale issues, multiple hydrologic and ecological pathways, and lack of predictive analysis. Our analysis shows there is a need for improved CEA for river systems, and in responding to this need we propose a conceptual framework for better integrating science and practice for improved CEA for river systems using one of the most adversely affected rivers basins in Canada, the Athabasca River, as our model. We conclude by addressing the challenges inherent to CEA with the intent of providing scientists with ways to help improve CEA of river systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the United States, this component has been largely missing from standard environmental impact assessment practice. Cumulative effects assessment provides a way to appraise the sustainability of project alternatives in terms of their probable contributions to long-term trends affecting the condition of valued environmental components. Sustainability metrics and predictors are being developed as criteria for rating systems and evaluation processes that are applied to community planning, building design, and transportation infrastructure. Increasing interest in adaptive management is also providing cost-effective solutions to optimizing safety and function throughout the long-term operation of a facility or infrastructure. Recent federal legislation is making it easier to integrate sustainability features into development alternatives through early, community-based planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our synthesis reviews relevant aspects of mining operations, describes the ecology of salmonid-bearing watersheds in northwestern North America, and compiles the impacts of metal and coal extraction on salmonids and their habitat. We conservatively estimate that this region encompasses nearly 4000 past producing mines, with present-day operations ranging from small placer sites to massive open-pit projects that annually mine more than 118 million metric tons of earth. Despite impact assessments that are intended to evaluate risk and inform mitigation, mines continue to harm salmonid-bearing watersheds via pathways such as toxic contaminants, stream channel burial, and flow regime alteration. To better maintain watershed processes that benefit salmonids, we highlight key windows during the mining governance life cycle for science to guide policy by more accurately accounting for stressor complexity, cumulative effects, and future environmental change.},

This article examines the implementation of effects-based CRA, which emphasizes evaluating health risks in a defined community or population, as opposed to stressor-based approaches, which focus on determining health risks for a defined set of stressors. It discusses the concept of vulnerability-based CRA as a potentially useful alternative, reviews the conceptual constructs that underpin CRA, surveys the diversity of methods available for putting effects-based principles into practice, identifies impediments hindering practical applications, and examines ways to make effects-based CRA more feasible.},

  abstract = {Land-use change is the largest proximate threat to biodiversity yet remains one of the most complex to manage. In British Columbia (BC), where large mammals roam extensive tracts of intact habitat, continued land-use development is of global concern. Extant mammal diversity in BC is unrivalled in North America owing, in part, to its unique position at the intersection of alpine, boreal, and temperate biomes. Despite high conservation values, understanding of cumulative ecological impacts from human development is limited. Using cumulative-effects-assessment (CEA) methods, we assessed the current human footprint over 16 regional ecosystems and 7 large mammal species. Using historical and current range estimates of the mammals, we investigated impacts of human land use on species' persistence. For ecosystems, we found that bunchgrass, coastal Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine have been subjected to over 50\% land-use conversion, and over 85\% of their spatial extent has undergone either direct or estimated indirect impacts. Of the mammals we considered, wolves were the least affected by land conversion, yet all species had reduced ranges compared with historical estimates. We found evidence of a hard trade-off between development and conservation, most clearly for mammals with large distributions and ecosystems with high levels of conversion. Rather than serve as a platform to monitor species decline, we strongly advocate these data be used to inform land-use planning and to assess current conservation efforts. More generally, CEAs offer a robust tool to inform wildlife and habitat conservation at scale.},

  abstract = {How do Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) evolve in Bangladesh regarding legislation? Who should be in the governance of SEA in Bangladesh? What future challenges lie ahead of this transition to the SEA system in Bangladesh, and how to address them? The application context of SEA is in its early stage of development in Bangladesh as an environmental assessment tool for policy, plans, and programs (PPPs). Nevertheless, SEA has meaningfully started to roll in many PPPs by the political will of some key government institutions in Bangladesh. In such a scenario, we aimed to review the progression of EIA to SEA evolution in line with the current legislative practice and environmental governance by archival research strategy. We have further addressed several significant issues: the future of SEA application in Bangladesh, SEA governance within the authorities and the future obstacles of the SEA system and how to overcome them in Bangladesh. This study shows a potential for applying the SEA for developing PPPs to ensure sustainable development in Bangladesh. However, there are still challenges ahead to make the SEA fully functional. The challenges include the environmental governance concerning SEA, encoding SEA guidelines, and legislations associated with SEA implementation. Moreover, capacity building, technical review of SEA quality, and approval process of SEA reporting and coordination among the government institutions are required. To address the challenges, governance for the institutional authority for SEA and ownership development is necessary. Furhtermore, amendment of existing environmental acts and guidelines to incorporate SEA, institutional capacity building by professional training and awareness development, mainstreaming SEA education and practices are required to overcome the challenges.},

  abstract = {Watersheds are under increasing stress from the cumulative environmental effects of water and land use disturbances caused by both anthropogenic and natural causes. Yet, while the science of watershed cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM) is advancing much less is known about the institutional and capacity requirements to implement and sustain watershed CEAM. Based on lessons from a transboundary watershed in western Canada this paper presents eight institutional requirements, or requisites, for the implementation of watershed-based CEAM. We suggest that effective watershed CEAM requires government leadership to move beyond the current inward focus on project approvals toward an outward focus on the cumulative effects of all disturbances in a watershed; complementary monitoring programs at the project and watershed scale, and a means to ensure the sharing of monitoring data across watershed stakeholders; and a nested planning framework to coordinate watershed planning objectives with individual project impact assessment and decision making. Results of this paper show that simply scaling up from individual project-based assessments to the watershed scale exposes many institutional constraints that can impede CEAM action.

  abstract = {To analyze the cumulative risks to the water environment, the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), a self-adapting algorithm, was proposed in this study. A new comprehensive indicator of cumulative risks was formed by combining the water risk assessment tool proposed by the World Wide Fund for Nature or World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG), and the cumulative environmental risk assessment system proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Eleven training algorithms were selected and optimized based on the mean square error (MSE) of prediction results. Data concerning evaluating indicators and cumulative risk indexes of the Liao River collected from 2005 to 2017 in the cities of Tieling, Shenyang, and Panjin, China, were used as input and output data to train, validate, and test the BP-ANN. Levenberg Marquardt backpropagation was the most accurate algorithm, with an MSE of 3.33 x 10(-6). After optimization, there were six hidden layers in the model. The correlation coefficient of the BP-ANN with LM exceeded 80\%. These findings suggest that the BP-ANN model is applicable to prediction of cumulative risks to the water environment. The model was sensitive to the number of wastewater treatment facilities and the wastewater treatment rate along the river. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the contributing factors can be controlled to reduce the cumulative risk.},

  abstract = {Cumulative impacts increasingly threaten marine and coastal ecosystems. To address this issue, the research community has invested efforts on designing and testing different methodological approaches and tools that apply cumulative impact appraisal schemes for a sound evaluation of the complex interactions and dynamics among multiple pressures affecting marine and coastal ecosystems. Through an iterative scientometric and systematic literature review, this paper provides the state of the art of cumulative impact assessment approaches and applications. It gives a specific attention to cutting-edge approaches that explore and model inter-relations among climatic and anthropogenic pressures, vulnerability and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems to these pressures, and the resulting changes in ecosystem services flow. Despite recent advances in computer sciences and the rising availability of big data for environmental monitoring and management, this literature review evidenced that the implementation of advanced complex system methods for cumulative risk assessment remains limited. Moreover, experts have only recently started integrating ecosystem services flow into cumulative impact appraisal frameworks, but more as a general assessment endpoint within the overall evaluation process (e.g. changes in the bundle of ecosystem services against cumulative impacts). The review also highlights a lack of integrated approaches and complex tools able to frame, explain, and model spatio-temporal dynamics of marine and coastal ecosystems' response to multiple pressures, as required under relevant EU legislation (e.g., Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives). Progress in understanding cumulative impacts, exploiting the functionalities of more sophisticated machine learning-based approaches (e.g., big data integration), will support decision-makers in the achievement of environmental and sustainability objectives.},

At one extreme of implementation, CEA can be described as merely an irritant to the completion of a project-specific environmental assessment (EA). At the other extreme, the conceptual view is that all effects in EA should be deemed cumulative unless demonstrated otherwise. Our purpose here is to consider how we might reconceive CEA as a mindset that is at the heart of absolutely every assessment of valued ecosystem component (VEC) to ensure that we understand the relative contributions of various stressors and can decide when cumulative effects may foreclose future activities due to impacts on VECs. Conceptually, we ground the CEA mindset in the context of three lenses that must all be functioning and working together for the mindset to be operative: a technical lens; a law and policy lens; and a participatory lens. Our arguments are based on a review of the CEA, strategic effects assessment (SEA) and regional effects assessment literatures, an examination and consideration of Canadian EA and SEA case practice, and our combined professional experiences. Through using the Bay of Fundy in Canada as a case example, we establish the concept of the CEA mindset and an approach for moving forward with implementation.},

  abstract = {Governments around the world rely on environmental impact assessment (EIA) to understand the environmental risks of proposed developments. To examine the basis for these appraisals, we examine the output of EIA processes in jurisdictions within seven countries, focusing on scope (spatial and temporal), mitigation actions and whether impacts were identified as `significant'. We find that the number of impacts characterized as significant is generally low. While this finding may indicate that EIA is successful at promoting environmentally sustainable development, it may also indicate that the methods used to assess impact are biased against findings of significance. To explore the methods used, we investigate the EIA process leading to significance determination. We find that EIA reports could be more transparent with regard to the spatial scale they use to assess impacts to wildlife. We also find that few reports on mining projects consider temporal scales that are precautionary with regard to the effects of mines on water resources. Across our sample of reports, we find that few EIAs meaningfully consider the different ways that cumulative impacts can interact. Across countries, we find that proposed mitigation measures are often characterized as effective without transparent justification, and sometimes are described in ways that render the mitigation measure proposal ambiguous. Across the reports in our sample, professional judgement is overwhelmingly the determinant of impact significance, with little transparency around the reasoning process involved or input by stakeholders. We argue that the credibility and accuracy of the EIA process could be improved by adopting more rigorous assessment methodologies and empowering regulators to enforce their use.

Resumen Los gobiernos a nivel mundial cuentan con los estudios de impacto ambiental para comprender los riesgos ambientales de las propuestas de desarrollo. Para juzgar la fiabilidad de estas evaluaciones, evaluamos los resultados de los estudios de impacto ambiental en las jurisdicciones de siete paises, enfocandonos en ambitos (espaciales y temporales), las acciones de mitigacion y si los impactos fueron identificados como “significativos”. Descubrimos que el numero de impactos adversos caracterizados como significativos fue generalmente bajo. Si bien este resultado puede indicar que la evaluacion de impacto ambiental es exitosa en la promocion del desarrollo ambiental sostenible, tambien puede indicar que los metodos utilizados para evaluar el impacto estan sesgados en contra de hallazgos de importancia. Para explorar los metodos utilizados, investigamos el proceso del estudio de impacto ambiental que conduce a la determinacion de importancia del impacto. Descubrimos que los informes de evaluacion de impacto ambiental podrian ser mas transparentes con respecto a la escala espacial utilizada para evaluar los impactos en la vida silvestre. Tambien encontramos que pocos informes sobre proyectos mineros consideran escalas temporales que son precautorias con respecto a los efectos de las minas sobre los recursos hidricos. En nuestra muestra de informes, encontramos que pocos estudios de impacto ambiental consideran de manera significativa las diferentes formas en que los impactos acumulativos pueden interactuar. En general encontramos que muchas de las medidas de mitigacion propuestas se caracterizan como efectivas sin una justificacion transparente y a veces se describen de manera que hacen que la propuesta de medida de mitigacion sea ambigua. En los informes de nuestra muestra, el juicio profesional es abrumadoramente el determinante de la importancia del impacto, sin una explicacion transparente de los procesos de razonamiento involucrados o aportes de las partes interesadas. Argumentamos que la credibilidad y precision del proceso de evaluacion de impacto ambiental podria mejorarse mediante la adopcion de metodologias de evaluacion mas rigurosas y el empoderamiento de los reguladores para hacer cumplir su uso. Resume Les gouvernements a travers le monde s'appuient sur les etudes d'impact environnemental pour comprendre les risques environnementaux des projets de developpement. Pour comprendre la base de ces evaluations, nous evaluons les resultats des etudes d'impact environnemental des juridictions de sept pays en nous concentrant sur la portee (spatiale et temporelle), les mesures d'attenuation et si les impacts ont ete identifies comme significatifs. Nous constatons que le nombre d'impacts consideres comme significatifs est generalement faible. Bien que ce resultat puisse indiquer que l'etude d'impact environnemental est efficace pour promouvoir un developpement durable sur le plan environnemental, elle peut egalement indiquer que les methodes utilisees pour evaluer les impacts sont biaisees par rapport a la determination de leurs ampleurs. Pour explorer les methodes utilisees, nous etudions le processus d'etudes d'impact environnemental menant a la determination de l'ampleur d'un impact. Nous constatons que les rapports des etudes d'impact environnemental pourraient etre plus transparents en ce qui concerne l'echelle spatiale utilisee pour evaluer les impacts sur la faune. Nous constatons egalement que peu de rapports sur les projets miniers considerent des echelles temporelles qui sont preventives en ce qui concerne les effets des mines sur les ressources hydriques. Dans notre echantillon de rapports, nous constatons que peu d'evaluations d'impact environnemental prennent en compte de facon significative les differentes manieres par lesquelles les impacts cumulatifs peuvent interagir. travers les pays, nous constatons que les mesures d'attenuation proposees sont souvent caracterisees comme efficaces sans justification transparente et sont parfois decrites de maniere a rendre la proposition de mesure d'attenuation ambigue. Dans les rapports de notre echantillon, le jugement professionnel est en grande partie le determinant de l'ampleur d'un impact, sans divulguer de facon transparente les processus de raisonnement employes ou sans une contribution des parties prenantes. Nous soutenons que la credibilite et l'exactitude des etudes d'impact environnemental pourraient etre ameliorees par l'adoption de methodologies d'evaluation plus rigoureuses et en habilitant les regulateurs a faire respecter leurs utilisations. Resumo Instituicoes governamentais ao redor do mundo se baseiam e confiam nas avaliacoes de impacto ambiental como forma de se entender os riscos ambientais dos projetos submetidos ao licenciamento. Para examinar os fundamentos dessas avaliacoes, investigamos os estudos de impacto ambiental em jurisdicoes em sete paises diferentes, com foco no escopo espaco-temporal, medidas de mitigacAo e a significancia dos impactos. Concluimos que o numero de impactos caracterizados como significativos e geralmente baixo. Embora essa descoberta possa indicar que a avaliacAo de impacto ambiental e bem sucedida na promocAo do ambiente sustentavel, ela tambem pode indicar que os metodos utilizados para avaliar impactos podem ser tendenciosos no que tange a determinacAo da significancia. Concluimos que a escala espacial utilizada para avaliar os impactos a vida silvestre em estudos de impacto ambiental devem ter criterios de delimitacAo mais transparentes. Tambem concluimos que poucos estudos de empreendimentos de mineracAo consideram escalas temporais conservadoras em relacAo aos seus impactos em recursos hidricos. Ainda, em nossa amostra, descobrimos que poucos estudos de impacto ambiental consideram as diferentes maneiras pelas quais os impactos cumulativos podem interagir entre si. Em todos os paises, descobrimos que as medidas de mitigacAo propostas sAo frequentemente caracterizadas como eficazes sem justificativa evidente e, que sAo descritas de forma ambigua. Em nossa amostra, a significancia de impactos foi predominantemente determinada por julgamento profissional, com pouca transparencia no processo do raciocinio envolvido nessa determinacAo ou na consideracAo das contribuicoes de stakeholders. Argumentamos que a credibilidade e o rigor do processo de avaliacAo de impacto ambiental podem ser melhorados atraves da adocAo de metodologias mais rigorosas e capacitacAo dos agentes do governo a exigir o cumprimento das mesmas.

  abstract = {Developing conservation strategies to mitigate cumulative impacts requires the understanding of historic land use and land cover changes at the regional scale. By using a multisensory and multitemporal approach, we identified the major changes driving cumulative impacts on native vegetation in northeastern Amazon. Comparing two regions, one with mining as the key driver and another where mining is associated with other industrial activities (cellulose), we explore the land use and land cover historic dynamics and derive implications for the assessment of cumulative impacts. Transitions of forest cover to pastureland, silviculture, and urban expansion were mapped in detail over a 20-year period, revealing that silviculture growth cleared more forests than pastureland expansion when associated with pulp mill activities and kaolin mining. In contrast, in a region with gold and iron mining, pastureland expansion was more relevant, clearing mainly areas surrounding new roads. This research shows that the interplay of major mining and industrial investments can produce cumulative losses of native vegetation, depending on the associated industries and infrastructure required for the project development. Our findings emphasize that the definition of spatial and temporal boundaries for the assessment of cumulative impacts must consider different trends in impact accumulation and changes in their spatial distribution over time.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and demonstrates a spatial framework for the application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in the context of change analysis for urban wetland environments. The proposed framework is focused on two key stages of the SEA process: scoping and environmental baseline assessment. These stages are arguably the most information-intense phases of SEA and have a significant effect on the quality of the SEA results. The study aims to meet the needs for proactive frameworks to assess and protect wetland habitat and services more efficiently, toward the goal of advancing more intelligent urban planning and development design. The proposed framework, adopting geographic information system and remote sensing tools and applications, supports the temporal evaluation of wetland change and sustainability assessment based on landscape indicator analysis. The framework was applied to a rapidly developing urban environment in the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, analyzing wetland change and land-use pressures from 1985 to 2011. The SEA spatial scale was rescaled from administrative urban planning units to an ecologically meaningful area. Landscape change assessed was based on a suite of indicators that were subsequently rolled up into a single, multi-dimensional, and easy to understand and communicate index to examine the implications of land-use change for wetland sustainability. The results show that despite the recent extremely wet period in the Canadian prairie region, land-use change contributed to increasing threats to wetland sustainability.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessments of ecosystem condition are needed to inform management processes such as systematic conservation planning and protected area expansion, marine spatial planning and other effective area-based conservation measures. Yet measuring the condition of dynamic and often largely inaccessible marine ecosystems is extremely difficult and presents a global challenge. Broad-scale cumulative impact assessments have been used in South Africa as a proxy for marine ecosystem condition in national assessments and reporting because the data are more readily available, and knowledge exists on the impacts of various human activities (or pressures) on marine ecosystems. While useful for national reporting, assessments based on in situ ecological data are also needed at finer scales relevant to management. Applying the HELCOM BEAT approach, this study used in situ ecological data to identify potential methods and indicators that can be applied in South Africa to conduct integrated ecosystem assessments and to assess the suitability of current cumulative impact assessments as a proxy for condition. Aggregated fish indicators demonstrated greater sensitivity to varying human pressures compared with benthic community indicators, with responsiveness differing by location. Notably, site-level differences in empirical condition emerged that broad-scale cumulative assessments often missed. The study thus highlighted the varying suitability of cumulative impact scores as proxies for condition, indicating their reliability for fish communities. However, this is also dependent on the pressure types included, the biotic indicators used and the area of focus. Conservation decisions based solely on cumulative impact scores could misrepresent the actual condition of the environment, which makes it difficult to make management decisions, especially at finer scales. As such, conservation initiatives need to be regionally adapted to effectively address the unique pressures and conditions of each area and should be tailored to account for fine-scale variability, instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach.},

  abstract = {The assessment of cumulative impacts is one of the most difficult tasks a NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) practitioner faces when preparing an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement, and it recently has become an increasing focus area of legal challenges. Historically, federal agencies have a very poor track record in this litigation. This research examines 25 recent judicial opinions involving challenges to various NEPA documents' cumulative impact analyses, from the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Challengers were victorious on their claims of inadequate analysis in 60\% of the cases decided in the 10-year analysis period. In recent years, the success rate for challengers has risen even higher, to victories in eight of 11 cases (72\%). The main reasons federal agencies have lost these court challenges is because they failed to present any cumulative impact analysis whatsoever in their NEPA document; they left out obvious past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions; or they provided undocumented assertions that their projects would not cause any cumulative impacts. Four key lessons for practitioners emerge from the results: (1) Make sure to include a discussion of cumulative impacts for each resource and include all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions; (2) Do not make unsubstantiated claims about cumulative impacts; (3) Assessments do not have to be perfect but should be thorough and based on data and explained rationales; and (4) Do not tie assessments solely to programmatic or non-NEPA documents.},

  abstract = {The EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC requires impact assessments called Appropriate Assessments (AA) for plans and projects probably having adverse effects on the sites of European ecological importance, Natura 2000 sites. Seventy-three Appropriate Assessment reports and seventy official opinions given on them by regional environmental authorities from 1997 to 2005 were reviewed. The findings of the study demonstrate typical shortcomings of ecological impact assessment: a weak information basis for assessment outcomes and lack of proper cumulative impact assessment with respect to ecological structures and processes. The quality of reporting has improved over time with respect to direct impacts on individual habitat types and species and detailed mitigation measures. Regional environment centres considered one fifth of the AA reports to be inadequate because of lacking data. In most cases the regional environment centres demanded a change of plan or project, added mitigation measures, choice of only one alternative for further planning or a new completed assessment with additional information in order to be able to evaluate the significance of the effects. The study underlines the need for iterative planning practices in which the preparation of a plan or project with alternative options goes hand in hand with the impact assessment equipped with sufficient data.

  abstract = {In this paper we quantify the additional water quality benefits that can be achieved through coordinated cumulative impact management. To do this we simulate coordinated and un-coordinated revegetation investments and compare their impact on achieving regional water quality goals. Our results show that coordination between multiple mining companies achieves additional benefits since prioritization is enabled across a broader range of investment opportunities. Additionally, when coordinated investment is permitted beyond the boundaries of coal mining leases, results show that additional benefits are greatly enhanced since these regions provide more rewarding investment opportunities. Results illustrate (a) how regional coordination may influence reputational benefits of investments, and (b) that coordination is beneficial when investment opportunities are unevenly distributed across the landscape. When additional benefits are achievable, we suggest that mining companies should develop collective investment projects with an understanding of how coordination influences project costs. Similarly, investment projects should be developed with an understanding of investment tradeoffs and how these may adversely impact on regional stakeholders and hence industry reputation. The mining industry has significant potential to contribute to regional wellbeing; however, land management policies must be flexible and promote incentives to enable companies to invest beyond compliance.

This article reviews conceptual frameworks of cumulative environmental change and describes analytical and institutional approaches to cumulative effects assessment (CEA). A causal model is a common theoretical construct, although the frameworks vary in their emphasis on different components of the model. Two broad approaches to CEA are distinguished: one scientific and the other planning oriented. These approaches should not be interpreted as competing paradigms but rather different interpretations of the scope of CEA. Each approach can provide a distinct but complementary contribution to the analysis, assessment, and management of cumulative effects. A comparison of the institutional and legislative response to CEA in Canada and the United States shows that Canada is following the American example of incorporating the analysis and assessment of cumulative effects into regulatory actions and administrative procedures that also govern environmental impact assessment.},

  abstract = {The U.S. is adopting a Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) approach to address conflicting objectives of conservation and resource development and usage in marine spaces. At this time MSP remains primarily as a concept rather than a well-defined framework, however expanding anthropogenic impacts on coastal and marine areas reinforce the need to adopt an MSP approach to manage societal demands while preserving the marine environment. The development of theory and methods to implement MSP are on the rise across the nation to address coastal and marine environmental challenges. Critical components of marine spatial planning are (1) spatial data collection, (2) data management, (3) data analysis, and (4) decision support systems. Advances in geotechnology have increased access to spatial data enabling the development of decision support tools to organize, analyze, and inform the MSP process by projecting future scenarios. A review of the current literature reveals the available technological and methodological tools that are best suited for marine spatial planning, as well as suggests areas for further research in order to better inform this process in the U.S. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) has rapidly become the most widely used integrated, place-based management approach in the marine environment. Monitoring and evaluation of MSP is key to inform best practices, adaptive management and plan iteration. While standardised evaluation frameworks cannot be readily applied, accounting for evaluation essentials such as the definition of evaluation objectives, indicators and stakeholder engagement of stakeholders is a prerequisite for meaningful evaluation outcomes. By way of a literature review and eleven practical MSP case studies, we analysed present day trends in evaluation approaches and unravelled the adoption of evaluation essentials for three categories for monitoring and evaluation for plan making, plan outcomes, and policy implementation. We found that at a global scale the focus of MSP evaluation has shifted over the past decade from evaluating predominantly plan outcomes towards the evaluation of plan making. Independent of the scope of the evaluation, evaluation approaches varied greatly from formal and structured processes, building for instance on MSP goals and objectives, to informal processes based on stakeholder interviews. We noted a trend in the adoption of formalised approaches where MSP evaluations have increasingly become linked to MSP policy goals and objectives. However, the enhanced use of MSP objectives and indicators did not result in a more straightforward reporting of outcomes, e.g. such as the achievement of specific MSP objectives. Overall, we found weak linkages between defined MSP objectives, indicators and available monitoring data. While the apparent shift towards a focus on objectives is promising, we highlight the need of fit-for purpose monitoring data to enable effective evaluation of those objectives. Hence, effective MSP and adaptive management processes require customised and concurrent monitoring and evaluation strategies and procedures. We argue that evaluation processes would also benefit from a better understanding of the general environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural effects of MSP. Therefore, to understand better environmental effects of MSP, we praise that forthcoming MSP processes need to deepen the understanding and considerations of cause-effect pathways between human activities and changes of ecosystem state through the adoption of targeted cumulative effects assessments.},

  abstract = {The global industrialization of seascapes and climate change leads to an increased risk of severe impacts on marine ecosystem functioning. While broad scale spatio-temporal assessments of human pressures on marine ecosystems become more available, future trajectories of human activities at regional and local scales remain often speculative. Here we introduce a stepwise process to integrate bottom-up and expert-driven approaches for scenario development to inform cumulative effects assessments and related marine spatial planning (MSP). Following this guidance, we developed optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenarios for major human pressures in the German North Sea such as bottom trawling, offshore wind, nutrient discharge, and aggregate extraction. The forecasts comprise quantitative estimates in relation to spatial footprint, intensity, and technological advancements of those pressures for the years 2030 and 2060. Using network analyses, we assessed interactions of the current and future trajectories of pressures thereby accounting for climate change and the growing need for marine conservation. Our results show that future scenarios of spatial distributions could be developed for activities that are spatially refined and included in the current MSP process. Further our detailed analyses of interdependencies of development components revealed that forecasts regarding specific targets and intensities of human activities depend also strongly on future technological advances. For fisheries and nutrient discharge estimates were less certain due to critical socio-ecological interactions in the marine and terrestrial realm. Overall, our approach unraveled such trade-offs and sources of uncertainties. Yet, our quantitative predictive scenarios were built under a sustainability narrative on a profound knowledge of interactions with other sectors and components in and outside the management boundaries. We advocate that they enable a better preparedness for future changes of cumulative pressure on marine ecosystems.},

Cumulative effect assessments (CEAs) are needed to inform environmental policy and guide ecosystem-based management. Yet, CEAs are inherently complex and seldom linked to real-world management processes. Therefore we propose entrenching CEAs in a risk management process, comprising the steps of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. We provide guidance to operationalize a risk-based approach to CEAs by describing for each step guiding principles and desired outcomes, scientific challenges and practical solutions. We reviewed the treatment of uncertainty in CEAs and the contribution of different tools and data sources to the implementation of a risk based approach to CEAs. We show that a risk-based approach to CEAs decreases complexity, allows for the transparent treatment of uncertainty and streamlines the uptake of scientific outcomes into the science-policy interface. Hence, its adoption can help bridging the gap between science and decision-making in ecosystem-based management.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires an assessment of the cumulative effects of human pressures and environmental change. The operationalization and integration of cumulative effects assessments (CEA) into decision-making processes often lacks a comprehensive and transparent framework. A risk-based CEA framework that divides a CEA in risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation, could structure such complex analyses and facilitate the establishment of direct science-policy links. Here, we examine carefully the operationalization of such a risk-based CEA framework with the help of eleven contrasting case studies located in Europe, French Polynesia, and Canada. We show that the CEA framework used at local, sub-regional, and regional scales allowed for a consistent, coherent, and transparent comparison of complex assessments. From our analysis, we pinpoint four emerging issues that, if accurately addressed, can improve the take up of CEA outcomes by management: 1) framing of the CEA context and defining risk criteria; 2) describing the roles of scientists and decision-makers; 3) reducing and structuring complexity; and 4) communicating uncertainty. Moreover, with a set of customized tools we describe and analyze for each case study the nature and location of uncertainty as well as trade-offs regarding available knowledge and data used for the CEA. Ultimately, these tools aid decision-makers to recognize potential caveats and repercussions of management decisions. One key recommendation is to differentiate CEA processes and their context in relation to governance advice, marine spatial planning or regulatory advice. We conclude that future research needs to evaluate how effective management measures are in reducing the risk of cumulative effects. Changing governance structures takes time and is often difficult, but we postulate that well-framed and structured CEA can function as a strategic tool to integrate ecosystem considerations across multiple sectorial policies.},

  abstract = {Humans are placing more strain on the world's oceans than ever before. Furthermore, marine ecosystems are seldom subjected to single stressors, rather they are frequently exposed to multiple, concurrent stressors. When the combined effect of these stressors is calculated and mapped through cumulative impact assessments, it is often assumed that the effects are additive. However, there is increasing evidence that different combinations of stressors can have non-additive impacts, potentially leading to synergistic and unpredictable impacts on ecosystems. Accurately predicting how stressors interact is important in conservation, as removal of certain stressors could provide a greater benefit, or be more detrimental than would be predicted by an additive model. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of additive, synergistic, and antagonistic stressor interaction effects using seagrasses as case study ecosystems. We found that additive interactions were the most commonly reported in seagrass studies. Synergistic and antagonistic interactions were also common, but there was no clear way of predicting where these non-additive interactions occurred. More studies which synthesise the results of stressor interactions are needed to be able to generalise interactions across ecosystem types, which can then be used to improve models for assessing cumulative impacts.},

  abstract = {Human activities put stress on our oceans and with a growing global population, the impact is increasing. Stressors rarely act in isolation, with the majority of marine areas being impacted by multiple, concurrent stressors. Marine spatial cumulative impact assessments attempt to estimate the collective impact of multiple stressors on marine environments. However, this is difficult given how stressors interact with one another, and the variable response of ecosystems. As a result, assumptions and generalisations are required when attempting to model cumulative impacts. One fundamental assumption of the most commonly applied, semi quantitative cumulative impact assessment method is that a change in modelled cumulative impact is correlated with a change in ecosystem condition. However, this assumption has rarely been validated with empirical data. We tested this assumption using a case study of seagrass in a large, inverse estuary in South Australia (Spencer Gulf). We compared three different seagrass condition indices, based on survey data collected in the field, to scores from a spatial cumulative impact model for the study area. One condition index showed no relationship with cumulative impact, whilst the other two indices had very small, negative relationships with cumulative impact. These results suggest that one of the most commonly used methods for assessing cumulative impacts on marine systems is not robust enough to accurately reflect the effect of multiple stressors on seagrasses; possibly due to the number and generality of assumptions involved in the approach. Future methods should acknowledge the complex relationships between stressors, and the impact these relationships can have on ecosystems. This outcome highlights the need for greater evaluation of cumulative impact assessment outputs and the need for data-driven approaches. Our results are a caution for marine scientists and resource managers who may rely on spatial cumulative impact assessment outputs for informing policy and decision-making.

Traditionally, future human activities are included in CIA using an analytical platform, commonly based on complex models that supply precise predictions but with reduced accuracy. To compensate for the lack of accuracy in current CIA approaches, we propose a shift in the paradigm governing CIA. The paradigm shift involves a change in the focus of CIA investigations from the detailed analysis of one unlikely future to the identification of the patterns describing multiple potential future changes in the environment. To illustrate the approach, a set of 144 possible and equally likely futures were developed that aimed to identify the potential impacts of forest harvesting and petroleum drilling on the habitat suitability of moose and marten in northeast British Columbia, Canada. The evolution of two measures of habitat suitability (average habitat suitability index and surface of the stands with habitat suitability index ¿ 0.5) revealed that the human activities could induce cycles in the habitat dynamics of moose and marten. The planning period of 100 years was separated into three distinct periods following a sinusoidal pattern (i.e., increase - constant - decrease in the habitat suitability measures). The attributes that could induce significant changes in the assessment of environment are the choice of harvesting age and species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Indicator selection is a critical step in conducting effective strategic cumulative effects assessments. Selecting an appropriate set of indicators to represent multiple and sometimes disparate values is particularly challenging because the interpretation of impacts depends on indicator roles and relationships among indicators. However, systematic approaches for selection of indicators for strategic cumulative effects assessments (CEA) are unclear. For a 909,000 ha case study area involving 214 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, we defined a suite of twenty indicators linked to six Valued Components (VCs) that could be forecasted for forest, riparian and species at risk as three key values consistent with present land-use planning policies in British Columbia, Canada. We used spatio-temporal process-based models to project and integrate the stressor-response relationships between forest harvesting and run-of-river power resource management activities and the suite of selected indicators. For a likely development scenario, we assessed the correlative structure among projected indicator responses and, using a PCA-based analysis of outcomes, identified both patterns of potential redundancies and ecological processes linking indicators and dominant processes influencing VCs. Our results suggest that strategic CEAs will benefit if indicator selections are not made independently for each VC. Identifying the type of indicator, i.e., pressure or condition, and scale of its representation was important in determining if assessed impacts for individual indicators could be appropriately integrated to quantify overall impacts in the landscape. Consideration of indicator-indicator relationships both within and among VCs clarifies the influences of spatial scale, potential redundancies among indicators, and the role of underlying ecological processes in interpreting and aggregating indicator responses. Our case study demonstrates that relative scales of ecological processes, disturbances and management actions can limit how cohesive the interpretations of impacts may be across VCs in strategic CEA. Analysis of correlative structures among the twenty indicators suggested criteria-based statistical redundancies occurred between only two indicator pairs, however PCA suggested three ecological processes (road disturbance, Spotted Owl habitat state, retention and recruitment of old forest) were operating to relate behaviors of multiple indicators. Careful consideration of the interacting roles of ecological processes as they relate to values is required when determining appropriate indicators and designing how best to aggregate indicator results into an effective strategic CEA. A three step systematic and generalizable approach to forecasting present and future states of indicators will improve efficiencies and effectiveness of strategic CEA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In strategic cumulative effects assessments, significant methodological challenges exist for classifying and aggregating impacts when using multiple indicators to determine relative risks upon ecological values from anthropogenic developments. We present a strategic spatial modeling case study CEA (2012-2112) in a 909,000 ha forested landscape of Southwestern British Columbia. We explore decisions needed to calculate and aggregate modeled indicators of cumulative anthropogenic footprints on landscape conditions by examining the choice of quantitative methods. We compare how aggregated impact conclusions may differ for seven indicators grouped in two ways to represent three ecological values (Forest Ecosystems, Riparian Ecosystems and Species at Risk): four expert-defined policy-driven valued components (VCs) or three analytically derived environmental resource factors (ERFs). By explicitly demonstrating methodological choices at each step of impact estimation and aggregation, we outline a practical systematic approach to customize strategic CEAs of this type and retain transparency for interpreting impacts among values. Aggregated impacts for VCs appeared dominated by those estimated from “condition” indicators describing the degree of expected deviations in indicator states from desired conditions; aggregated impacts of ERFs were dominated by “pressure” indicators linked to underlying causal processes assumed important for describing changes in future ecological conditions. High spatial congruence occurred between impact statements for some VCs compared to ERFs representing the same ecological value; poor congruence between others likely occurred because they represented different ecological processes. Aggregated impact classifications may usefully signal impact severity and risk but are dependent on indicator grouping, hence choices for aggregation are integral to the assessment process.},

  abstract = {In the Space@Sea project a conceptual study is performed to develop standardized cost efficient floating modular islands with low environmental impact. As these floating modular islands are introduced for a purpose which is likely to determine the environmental impact, possible applications were considered: living, aquaculture, ports and logistics, and energy hub. The aim of this study is to develop a structured approach for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) of floating modular islands and their applications as these are considered within the Space@Sea project. To contribute to the efficiency and sustainability of future floating island developments, early awareness of the likely environmental consequences is important and requires a solid knowledge base. To that end we recommend a screening approach to identify the main threats to the marine ecosystem and their potential impacts at the earliest (conceptual) stage of development. For each Space@Sea type of application, this screening approach should identify the main threats through an EIA that links critical pressures with sensitive ecosystem components. While conventional impact assessments only consider negative impacts, we also consider potential environmental benefits of floating islands. This not only to enhance more environmental-friendly designs but also to provide a balanced perspective which considers not only threats but also opportunities in future developments and implementation of floating islands and their applications.},

Biodiversity impact assessment of Indira Sagar and Omkareshwar dams on the river Narmada that were conducted during 1990-94 is retrospectively analyzed to demonstrate the utility of the Habitat Evaluation Procedure as a quantitative method and its capability to predict long-term trends in habitat quality. Results of a multiple scenario simulation on habitat quality change over thirty years (1991-2020) indicate that there still exists an opportunity to conserve the biodiversity in the region by enhancing the protection status of the forests surrounding the dam reservoirs and proper resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected population. Further, limitations of Indian EIA with reference to biodiversity integration into Mitigation Hierarchy, Cumulative Impacts Assessment, Governance, SEA and post-audit are addressed. Indian policy needs to integrate biodiversity into earlier stages of decision making, not only to achieve its 2030 SDG targets, but also to ensure ecological security which is essential for the long-term socio-economic development of the nation.},

  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is (or should be) an integral part of environmental assessment at both the project and the more strategic level. CEA helps to link the different scales of environmental assessment in that it focuses on how a given receptor is affected by the totality of plans, projects and activities, rather than on the effects of a particular plan or project. This article reviews how CEAs consider, and could consider, scale issues: spatial extent, level of detail, and temporal issues. It is based on an analysis of Canadian project-level CEAs and UK strategic-level CEAs. Based on a review of literature and, especially, case studies with which the authors are familiar, it concludes that scale issues are poorly considered at both levels, with particular problems being unclear or non-existing cumulative effects scoping methodologies; poor consideration of past or likely future human activities beyond the plan or project in question; attempts to apportion ‘blame’ for cumulative effects; and, at the plan level, limited management of cumulative effects caused particularly by the absence of consent regimes. Scale issues are important in most of these problems. However both strategic-level and project-level CEA have much potential for managing cumulative effects through better siting and phasing of development, demand reduction and other behavioural changes, and particularly through setting development consent rules for projects. The lack of strategic resource-based thresholds constrains the robust management of strategic-level cumulative effects.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are prone to tipping points, particularly in coastal zones where dramatic changes are associated with interactions between cumulative stressors (e.g., shellfish harvesting, eutrophication and sediment inputs) and ecosystem functions. A common feature of many degraded estuaries is elevated turbidity that reduces incident light to the seafloor, resulting from multiple factors including changes in sediment loading, sea-level rise and increased water column algal biomass. To determine whether cumulative effects of elevated turbidity may result in marked changes in the interactions between ecosystem components driving nutrient processing, we conducted a large-scale experiment manipulating sediment nitrogen concentrations in 15 estuaries across a national-scale gradient in incident light at the seafloor. We identified a threshold in incident light that was related to distinct changes in the ecosystem interaction networks (EIN) that drive nutrient processing. Above this threshold, network connectivity was high with clear mechanistic links to denitrification and the role of large shellfish in nitrogen processing. The EIN analyses revealed interacting stressors resulting in a decoupling of ecosystem processes in turbid estuaries with a lower capacity to denitrify and process nitrogen. This suggests that, as turbidity increases with sediment load, coastal areas can be more vulnerable to eutrophication. The identified interactions between light, nutrient processing and the abundance of large shellfish emphasizes the importance of actions that seek to manage multiple stressors and conserve or enhance shellfish abundance, rather than actions focusing on limiting a single stressor.},

  abstract = {Wind and hydropower are important renewable components of national energy portfolios, but their infrastructure negatively affects biodiversity. Regional development requires identification of scenarios that minimize the cumulative impacts of multiple facilities. We introduce the cumulative impact plot (CIP) to quantify cumulative impacts of renewable energy development within a region. Summed impacts of facilities are plotted as a function of the number of facilities, with facilities ranked by increasing (the best-case scenario) or decreasing (worst-case scenario) individual impact. These curves represent lower and upper bounds to which alternative development scenarios (e.g., facilities ranked by generating capacity) can be compared. We used CIPs to assess overlap of potential wind and hydropower facilities with two types of conservation area in the United States: (1) federally protected lands and (2) critical habitats of federally threatened and endangered species. We evaluated two alternative scenarios: facilities ranked by (A) decreasing generating capacity and (B) increasing distance from urban centers. Differences between the best-case and worst-case scenarios were large, thus revealing opportunities to develop facilities with limited impact on conservation areas. Alternative scenarios maximizing energy density generally resulted in conservation area overlap intermediate to best-case and worst-case scenarios. CIPs can also identify the proportion of wind versus hydropower favored under alternative scenarios. Build-out scenarios aimed at minimizing conservation area overlap favor hydropower, whereas alternative scenarios favor wind power. We conclude that CIPs can (1) complement-but should not replace-project-level environmental impact assessment, (2) integrate strategic, cumulative, and scenario-based assessments, and (3) harness rapidly growing geospatial data.},

It reviews the CIA literature to address the shortcomings of impact assessments at both strategic and project levels. Subsequently, it suggests a synthesized approach bringing disturbance ecology and adaptive ecosystem approaches together to identify and predict impacts even in challenging data contexts. To illustrate how the synthesized approach can be utilized in CIA integration, it provides a case study from Turkey. The Belek tourism development plan is investigated by using the soft system methodology. Comparison of the actual and hypothetical situations of the case illustrates the possible and desirable changes to improve strategic decision-making. Accordingly, the paper addresses the key role of decision makers' mindsets and approaches to utilizing experience-based and science-based knowledges in considering cumulative impacts at the strategic level.

The knowledge of the spatial distribution of threats to ecosystems is fundamental to understanding their risk of collapse as defined by the Red List of Ecosystems, an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) global standard to guide conservation and management actions. Colombia is a megadiverse country; almost half of its territory is marine, and its ecosystems are subject to anthropogenic and climatic threats. MethodologyThis study provides a quantitative map assessment for a set of relevant anthropic and climatic threats and impacts on the marine and coastal areas of Colombia, intending to perform the threat description component of the Red List assessment protocol. A cumulative impact assessment was applied to analyze the threat levels (TLs) and impact levels of 12 anthropogenic and climatic pressures. ResultsThe observed TL patterns meet spatial expectations, revealing that the assessment units in the Caribbean Sea are more threatened than those in the Pacific Ocean, and continental areas are more threatened than the oceanic ones. Habitat transformation and sea warming were the threats with the most impact on coastal and marine ecosystems, respectively. Climatic threats were widely extended throughout the study area, occurring even in the most pristine zones (e.g., Malpelo Island). DiscussionClimate threats are challenging to national conservation strategies since these pressures are not completely manageable at local scales as they depend mainly on global efforts. Recommendations drawn from this work can guide actions for the conservation of the ecosystems of Colombia.},

  abstract = {The relationships between human footprint and measurable impacts to biodiversity and ecosystems are complex. Also problematic is the hesitancy to derive threshold-based management tools from the scientific literature. Road ecology points to road densities as a useful surrogate for human footprint, and the research is replete with links between cumulative effects and various density thresholds. Yet there are few practical examples demonstrating how to go about managing the cumulative effects to biodiversity and how to reduce human footprint for large-landscape conservation. In Alberta's Eastern Slopes, a sub-regional planning process resulted in regulatory density limits being deployed on public lands in the Livingstone-Porcupine Hills. The density limits are applied to two classes of motorized route-use - open public use and restricted use by statutory consent holders - and are informed by biodiversity modeling analysis. Several elements supported the establishment of these density limits including a robust regional planning framework, legislative and regulatory tools, and thorough community engagement and participation in the planning process. Implementation success depends on resources for operational management, education, enforcement, monitoring, and restoration. We examine the Livingstone-Porcupine Hills Land Footprint Management Plan as an example of a real-world approach to manage a common and growing problem. We demonstrate that there is sufficient scientific literature to support a conceptual framework for motorized route-user networks, and that real-world applications in threshold-based decision-making have practical merit. Density limits on motorized route-user networks constitute a viable cumulative effects management tool, especially for land managers seeking to maintain biodiversity and healthy ecosystems on large unprotected landscapes.

  abstract = {Population growth, during the twentieth century, has increased demand for new farmlands. Accordingly, road networks have rapidly been developed to facilitate and accelerate human access to the essential resources resulted in extensive land use changes. The present study aims at assessing cumulative effects of developed road network on tree cover of Golestan Province in northern Iran. In order to detect changes over the study period of 1987-2002, the LULC map of the study area was initially prepared from the satellite images of Landsat TM (1987) and ETM+ (2002) using maximum likelihood supervised classification method. Afterwards, a total number of seven landscape matrices were selected to detect cumulative effects of the developed road network on woodland cover. The obtained results indicated that the fragile patches are mainly located at a distance of 171-342 m from the roadside. Furthermore, the majority of the patches affected by cumulative effects of development activities are situated at a distance of 342-684 m from the roadside, over an approximate area of 55 ha. The analysis of landscape metrics revealed that the developed road network has increased the landscape metrics of “the number of patches” and “patches perimeter-area ratio”. It has also followed by a decrease in metrics such as “patches area”, “Euclidean nearest neighbor distance”, “patches proximity”, “shape index”, “contiguity”, and “mean patches fractal dimension”. The road network has also increased the “number of patches” and decreased the “mean patches area” representing further fragmentation of the landscape. With identification of highly affected wooldland cover patches, it would be possible to apply adaptive environmental management strategies to preserve and rehabilitate high-priority patches.},

This study investigates how GHG emissions have been, and potentially could be, assessed within the Australian CSG industry. The research involved a document analysis of several Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and consultant reports prepared as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for major CSG projects in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld). There were found to be inconsistencies in the conduct of greenhouse assessment by the CSG industry, including how complete and transparent assessments were, as well as how effectively they addressed project emission intensity and cumulative impacts. There were also found to be large inconsistencies between assessments carried out for Qld projects and those for NSW projects, likely because of differences in how assessment requirements are applied by planning bodies. This study also highlights how alternative assessment approaches, such as Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), have potential to enable a broader and more consistent understanding of emission sources that cross a range of geographical and project boundaries.},

  abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic pressures such as pollution, climate change or invasive species can have multiple impacts on ecosystems and the services (ES) they provide. To address the potential effects on ES provision, we propose a geospatial framework to identify and analyze the cumulative effects on terrestrial and freshwater ES. The framework includs an impact chain analysis based on ten pressures grouped into six categories (pollution, climate change, land-use change, overexploitation, land fragmentation, invasive species) and their single or multiple effects on five key ES of the Alpine environment (recreation, forest protection, CO2 sequestration, habitat maintenance, grassland biomass). Results show that the areas most affected by cumulative effects were located in major urban centers, in the Po Valley, Germany, Slovenia, and in coastal areas of the Adriatic Sea. The spatial coincidence analysis of pressure P-ES on IUCN protected sites showed that protection categories IV and V mostly had high P/high ES scores. Our approach will help in management and planning for mountain conservation aimed at reducing multi-pressure occurrences in transboundary environments. The framework can be used to identify areas with the highest ES provision, characterize areas with high stress from anthropogenic pressures, and examine the effects of pressures on protected areas.},

  abstract = {Despite being adopted worldwide, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is under pressure in many countries, while perceived (rightly or wrongly) as an ineffective and inefficient process. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is thought to help address some of EIA's shortcomings, but it is absent in many jurisdictions and sectors. In this paper, we argue that multi-project EIA can, in some contexts, simultaneously deliver greater effectiveness and process streamlining. To illustrate our claim, we present a case study from offshore petroleum production in Brazil, where the development of the pre-salt giant reserves is being licensed through a multi-project EIA approach, in a non-SEA planning environment. The analysis provides interesting insights on the strengths and challenges of that strategy, focusing on five aspects of practice: cumulative impacts, efficiency, approach to authorizations, follow-up and political issues. Proper scoping was found to be essential to consistent EIA processes and shorter review times. Finally, we suggest that multi-project EIA approach should be revisited by practitioners and regulators to identify opportunities for deployment, especially in jurisdictions where strategic assessments are not in place.},

National strategic environmental assessment (SEA) guidelines were finalized in 2012 to adapt and enhance SEA practice in the Kenyan context. The purpose of this research was to examine recent Kenyan SEA, with a particular emphasis on public participation, by developing and applying an analysis framework that both incorporates commonly accepted SEA principles and approaches and is cognizant of the national context in shaping SEA practice. Results reveal that a number of SEA practices are consistent with the framework in the nine cases considered, such as containing standard SEA components and developing monitoring plans. A requirement that each SEA must include educating the public about SEA is an innovative local adaptation. Results also show a number of practices that are still emerging, such as initiating SEA early and disseminating results to the participants. We conclude that SEA is still developing in Kenya, but processes for conducting it are slowly adapting to the Kenyan context.},

  abstract = {Environmental impact assessments for new Arctic infrastructure do not adequately consider the likely long-term cumulative effects of climate change and infrastructure to landforms and vegetation in areas with ice-rich permafrost, due in part to lack of long-term environmental studies that monitor changes after the infrastructure is built. This case study examines long-term (1949???2020) climate-and road-related changes in a network of ice-wedge polygons, Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, Alaska. We studied four trajectories of change along a heavily traveled road and a relatively remote site. During 20 years prior to the oilfield development, the climate and landscapes changed very little. During 50 years after development, climate-related changes included increased numbers of thermokarst ponds, changes to ice-wedge-polygon morphology, snow distribution, thaw depths, dominant vegetation types, and shrub abundance. Road dust strongly affected plant-community structure and composition, particularly small forbs, mosses, and lichens. Flooding increased permafrost degradation, polygon center-trough elevation contrasts, and vegetation productivity. It was not possible to isolate infrastructure impacts from climate impacts, but the combined datasets provide unique insights into the rate and extent of ecological disturbances associated with infrastructure-affected landscapes under decades of climate warming. We conclude with recommendations for future cumulative impact assessments in areas with ice-rich permafrost.},

  abstract = {Setting social, economic, and ecological objectives is ultimately a process of social choice informed by science. In this special feature we provide a multidisciplinary framework for the use of cumulative effects assessment in land use planning. Forest ecosystems are facing considerable challenges driven by population growth and increasing demands for resources. In a suite of case studies that span the boreal forest of Western Canada to the interior Atlantic forest of Paraguay we show how transparent and defensible methods for scenario analysis can be applied in data-limited regions and how social dimensions of land use change can be incorporated in these methods, particularly in aboriginal communities that have lived in these ecosystems for generations. The case studies explore how scenario analysis can be used to evaluate various land use options and highlight specific challenges with identifying social and ecological responses, determining thresholds and targets for land use, and integrating local and traditional knowledge in land use planning. Given that land use planning is ultimately a value-laden and often politically charged process we also provide some perspective on various collective and expert-based processes for identifying cumulative impacts and thresholds. The need for good science to inform and be informed by culturally appropriate democratic processes calls for well-planned and multifaceted approaches both to achieve an informed understanding of both residents and governments of the interactive and additive changes caused by development, and to design action agendas to influence such change at the ecological and social level.},

  abstract = {The decline in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations in Alberta lead to classification as a threatened species. Rapid industrial development continues to affect caribou habitat. Natural and anthropogenic factors, which affect population dynamics, act cumulatively. We developed an interactive cumulative effects model, which could be used to assess both natural and anthropogenic factors influencing survival of caribou. This model is based on functional and numerical responses of carnivores (wolves (Canis lupus)), herbivores (caribou and moose (Alces alces)) and resources (lichen and vascular plants). It includes stochasticity in some elements and is aspatial (but divides habitat into categories depending on habitat type and age). Based on simulation experiments, we suggest that the most detrimental factor on caribou population dynamics is the functional loss of habitat due to avoidance of good quality habitat in proximity of industrial infrastructures. We argue that in the natural boreal ecosystem, habitat was not limiting caribou in northern Alberta, and caribou could coexist with uncontrolled wolf populations that kept caribou at low densities of about 0.1 km(-2). We argue that wolf control is not a practical solution in caribou conservation and propose different alternatives. We also suggest potential thresholds for industrial development for specific interactions of different predation pressures and habitat carrying capacity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Part of the problem is that there currently exists only limited guidance as to how to use the existing scientific tools, conceptual frameworks and guidance documents to advance cumulative effects assessment (CEA) from the project scale to the broader regional scale at which land-use planning occurs. To strengthen CEA science for wetlands there are three minimum requirements: (1) understand the baseline science of wetland functions; (2) delineate the primary drivers (anthropogenic and natural) of disturbance; and (3) develop the science to link drivers to changes in wetland function in an interactive, synergistic and cumulative way. The paper concludes by identifying ways in which the state of CEA science and management of wetlands could be improved.},

Tools for integrated policy and management meet a wide range of functions and originate from a variety of fields, from the physical and biological sciences to social sciences and organizational studies. Some of the tools presented at the 2009 Gulf of Maine symposium are discussed in this paper. Knowledge gaps still exist regarding impacts of development and industrial activities, which becomes apparent when trying to evaluate and quantify cumulative impacts. Geographic information system-based tools and elements of marine spatial planning such as human use mapping can help establish better cumulative impact assessments. While it is recognized that advances in integrated policy and management have occurred since the previous (1996) Gulf of Maine science symposium, evaluation of that progress is still in development. Tools such as state of the environment reporting, integrated assessments/ecosystem overviews, frameworks for implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM), or approaches developed by the EBM Tools Network all assist in measuring and evaluating our progress towards full implementation of an ecosystem approach within the context of management activities and actions.},

Regulations requiring ad-hoc assessments can lead to death by a thousand cuts, where biodiversity is degraded by many small impacts that individually do not appear to threaten species' persistence. Spatial prioritization methods can improve the efficiency of decision-making by explicitly considering cumulative impacts of multiple proposed developments on multiple species over large spatial scales. We present an assessment approach and a unique case study in which spatial prioritization tools were used to support strategic assessment of a large development plan in Western Australia. The application of the approach helped identify relatively minor alterations to development plans that resulted in reductions in biodiversity impacts and informed expansion of the protected area network. Using these tools to assess trade-offs between conservation and development will help identify planning footprints that minimize biodiversity losses.},

  abstract = {Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.

  abstract = {Human pressure on the environment is expanding and intensifying, especially in coastal and offshore areas. Major contributors to this are the current push for offshore renewable energy sources, which are thought of as environmentally friendly sources of power, as well as the continued demand for petroleum. Human disturbances, including the noise almost ubiquitously associated with human activity, are likely to increase the incidence, magnitude, and duration of adverse effects on marine life, including stress responses. Stress responses have the potential to induce fitness consequences for individuals, which add to more obvious directed takes (e.g., hunting or fishing) to increase the overall population-level impact. To meet the requirements of marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, many efforts are ongoing to quantify the cumulative impacts of all human actions on marine species or populations. Meanwhile, regulators face the challenge of managing these accumulating and interacting impacts with limited scientific guidance. We believe there is scientific support for capping the level of impact for (at a minimum) populations in decline or with unknown statuses. This cap on impact can be facilitated through implementation of regular application cycles for project authorization or improved programmatic and aggregated impact assessments that simultaneously consider multiple projects. Cross-company collaborations and a better incorporation of uncertainty into decision making could also help limit, if not reduce, cumulative impacts of multiple human activities. These simple management steps may also form the basis of a rudimentary form of marine spatial planning and could be used in support of future ecosystem-based management efforts.},

  abstract = {Coastal habitats provide important benefits to people, including habitat for species targeted by fisheries and opportunities for tourism and recreation. Yet, such human activities also can imperil these habitats and undermine the ecosystem services they provide to people. Cumulative risk assessment provides an analytical framework for synthesizing the influence of multiple stressors across habitats and decision-support for balancing human uses and ecosystem health. To explore cumulative risk to habitats in the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Ocean Planning regions, we apply the open-source InVEST Habitat Risk Assessment model to 13 habitats and 31 stressors in an exposure-consequence framework. In doing so, we advance the science priorities of EBM and both regional planning bodies by synthesizing the wealth of available data to improve our understanding of human uses and how they affect marine resources. We find that risk to ecosystems is greatest first, along the coast, where a large number of stressors occur in close proximity and secondly, along the continental shelf, where fewer, higher consequence activities occur. Habitats at greatest risk include soft and hard-bottom nearshore areas, tidal flats, soft-bottom shelf habitat, and rocky intertidal zones-with the degree of risk varying spatially. Across all habitats, our results indicate that rising sea surface temperatures, commercial fishing, and shipping consistently and disproportionally contribute to risk. Further, our findings suggest that management in the nearshore will require simultaneously addressing the temporal and spatial overlap as well as intensity of multiple human activities and that management in the offshore requires more targeted efforts to reduce exposure from specific threats. We offer a transparent, generalizable approach to evaluating cumulative risk to multiple habitats and illustrate the spatially heterogeneous nature of impacts along the eastern Atlantic coast and the importance of spatial scale in estimating such impacts. These results offer a valuable decision-support tool by helping to constrain the decision space, focus attention on habitats and locations at the greatest risk, and highlight effect management strategies.},

  abstract = {Using alternative future scenarios in development planning supports the integration of diverse perspectives and the joint consideration of the needs of humans and nature. Here, we report on the use of scenarios as an integral part of a two-year sustainable development planning process for Andros Island, The Bahamas. We combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to link stakeholder visions of the future of their island with quantitative assessments of the likely impacts of those visions on future conditions. We highlight knowledge gains for scenarios in three key areas: (1) inclusion of participatory mapping as both a mechanism for eliciting stakeholder knowledge and aspirations, and as an input for risk assessment; (2) participation of a transdisciplinary team to guide the scenario creation process and enable better understanding of the range of stakeholder visions and values; and (3) use of cumulative risk assessment as a framework to bring together quantitative and qualitative information and provide objective comparisons between alternatives. We convened over 560 people in 35 meetings and worked with 13 government ministries to create and compare four alternative scenarios consisting of storylines and maps of habitat risk of degradation. We found that one scenario, featuring intensive development, would pose the greatest risk to habitats and worked together to understand which activities could lead to such a future and what interventions could be taken to help avoid it. Ultimately, our collaborative process yielded objective comparisons between alternative future scenarios, incorporated diverse visions and values of stakeholders into the island-wide master plan, and informed investments in the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and infrastructure critical for the livelihoods of island communities. This process can serve as an example for scientists and practitioners worldwide seeking to use scenarios to inform sustainable development planning.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the assessment of cumulative environmental impacts and the implementation of integrated coastal management within the harbour of Xiamen, China, an urban region in which the coastal zone is under increasing pressure as a result of very rapid economic growth. The first stage of analysis incorporates components of a cumulative effects assessment, including (a) identification of sources of environmental impacts, notably industrial expansion, port development, shipping, waste disposal, aquaculture and coastal construction, (b) selection of a set of valued ecosystem components, focusing on circulation and siltation, water quality, sediment, the benthic community' and mangrove forests, and (c) use of a set of key indicators to examine cumulative impacts arising from the aggregate of human activities. In the second stage of analysis, the paper describes and assesses the development of an institutional framework for integrated coastal management in Xiamen, one that combines policy and planning (including legislative and enforcement mechanisms) with scientific and monitoring mechanisms (including an innovative `marine functional zoning' system). The paper concludes that the integrated coastal management framework in Xiamen has met all relevant requirements for `integration' as laid out in the literature, and has explicitly incorporated consideration of cumulative impacts within its management and monitoring processes.

  abstract = {The cumulative impacts of human and natural activity on forest landscapes in Alberta are clear. Human activity, such as forestry and oil and gas development, and natural processes such as wildfire leave distinctive marks on the composition, age class structure and spatial configuration of the forest. Also, other processes such as climate change may be slowly and subtly modifying forest dynamics and may lead to important changes over time. Given the importance and ubiquitous nature of these cumulative impacts, a forest management plan that does not adequately take such impacts into account cannot be expected to adequately manage the forest, neither its components nor its processes. In order to address the question of cumulative impacts in the context of forestry, a landscape model was designed and built in order to simulate forestry, oil and gas, climate change, wildfire, and demographic change for the Whitecourt forest management area over a long time horizon. This paper presents the model and the forest landscape states it forecasted with cumulative impacts, and evaluates the fate of some key indicators of biodiversity and forest productivity Simulations of harvesting as the only disturbance, the nearest analogue to the current approach to forest management planning, yield results that differ greatly, in every respect, from the results of simulations of harvesting combined with other disturbance agents. The simulation of multiple disturbance agents together allows for the detection of interactions among disturbance agents, and indeed, there are important interactions between the processes of fire and oil and gas. Results also show that climate and demographic change will intensify the impact of fire on the supply of timber and other values. Also, the continued development of petroleum resources will lead to an important erosion of the forest landbase. Overall, this paper makes a strong case for cumulative impacts assessment and the use of spatial and temporal stochastic modelling in forest management.},

This paper reviews recent literature to clarify what is known and not known about the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of the process chemicals and wastewaters generated in hydraulic fracturing, the mechanisms and pathways by which they enter surface water and groundwater aquifers and the risks posed to human and ecosystem health. Assessing the impacts of unconventional shale gas development is clearly constrained by a lack of baseline information, complex hydrogeological histories for natural migration of hydrocarbons, lack of tracers to monitor and verify the source, timing and mechanism of contaminant migration into water resources. This is compounded by lack of transparency and accountability in policy decisions. The paper argues that managing the social and environmental risks of unconventional shale gas development calls for a new generation of impact assessment, one that marries the ideals of strategic environmental assessment, cumulative effects assessment, backcasting and deliberative and inclusive processes of community engagement towards collective risk management.},
