This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

I recently decided to finally build my own website, including a blog, after many failed attempts throughout the years. My typical workflow has been to initiate a website with a tool I did not have time to fully commit to, then proceed to lose interest and whatever expertise I gleaned from using the chosen tool. Of course, I focused on the format rather than the content, so I kept being left with nothing functional to work with. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

This time around, I had an incentive to switch from using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a move we agreed upon in the startup I co-founded, [*inSileco*](https://insileco.io/). Quarto is (so far) amazingly simple and straightforward to use to build websites, so I figured that I might as well take the opportunity to build my own website with a tool that I know I will be using for the foreseeable future. 

As a nod to Quarto, I decided to directly use their template for the first blog post "Welcome To My Blog". 

Welcome to my blog!
